essential today than ever and last announcement a pitch really One of the most important ways the State Department serves the American people is through issuing passports Last year we issued more than 20 million of them as a part of our commitment to U.S. travelers most people are n't thinking of getting a passport for their summer vacation in the middle of winter but they should be applying during the winter season when there is less demand means faster processing times This winter we 're pleased to host special passport acceptance fairs at our passport agencies across the country we 're also accepting passport applications at travel and adventure shows around the country from January through March these events are open to the public and will be a perfect time to apply for passports for both adults and children you can check out travel.state.gov for more information and also follow our winter passport campaign on facebook Twitter and Instagram @TravelGov so beat the summer rush and apply for your passports now with that i will introduce our briefer this morning special representative for Iran Brian Hook joins us here today to discuss the latest on our Iran policy and to make an announcement of his own Brian mr hook good morning First i have an update on our maximum pressure campaign and then i will discuss the various crises that today the regime in Tehran is struggling to manage secretary Pompeo repeatedly promised that he will hold the Iranian regime accountable for its human rights violations and for its treatment of the Iranian people Today we are continuing to deliver on this promise The United States is listing IRGC brigadier general Hassan Shahvarpour under Section 7031(c visa sanctions general Shahvarpour committed gross violations of human rights against protesters in Mahshahr he oversaw the massacre of 148 helpless Iranians in the mahshahr region last November general Shahvarpour was in command of units responsible for the violent crackdown and lethal repression around Mahshahr this is the first designation on an Iranian regime official being taken under the State Department authority from section 7031(c authorities this action taken today was made possible through the information we received on the tip line that the secretary established the Iranian people have now sent us over 88,000 tips through the tip line that the secretary established back in November we use this information to expose the criminality of the regime and to hold violators accountable since the violent crackdown on protests last November the United States has sanctioned two judges and eight other regime officials for their roles in brutalizing the Iranian people we are continuing to review all information we receive from the Iranian people and we will continue to hold more regime officials responsible for human rights violations over the past week many Iranians took to the streets again to protest a corrupt government that lies to them president Trump recognized their courage with his tweets in Farsi this past week standing with the Iranian people we call on all nations to join our lead particularly by sanctioning Iranian officials for human rights violations the Iranian regime is in a deep economic crisis back in May of 2018 shortly after leaving the Iran nuclear deal secretary Pompeo said that we will deny revenue to Iran 's clerics who use it to fund terrorism and violence across the region he said that Iran 's expansionist foreign policy would no longer be cost free and that the economic price would be severe we have succeeded in raising the costs for Iran and the regime is badly managing an economic crisis of its own making the sanctions we have imposed are the toughest ever they are making an enormous difference and the Iranian people are rightly blaming their own government for 40 years of corruption mismanagement and kleptocracy Iran 's oil exports are down by more than 2 million barrels per day reducing Iran 's revenue from oil by more than 80 percent this amounts to a loss of around $ 50 billion annually Last month president Rouhani admitted that Iran had lost $ 200 billion from U.S. sanctions since their re imposition Iran is also facing a banking crisis with roughly half of all bank loans in arrears More than one in four young Iranians is jobless inflation is at 40 percent Today the question that people are asking is whether the regime has the competence to avoid a banking disaster and hyperinflation the economy the Iranian economy this year could contract by as much as 14 percent the regime is also facing a budget crisis to fund its new 2020 budget which comes out in March due to the staggering loss of oil revenue it is nearly impossible for the regime to put forward a credible budget after initially assuming oil exports would average 1.5 million barrels of oil per day in fy19 the regime later revised the figure down to 300,000 barrels Today Iran 's supreme leader in remarks said that the country 's reliance on oil should stop it is therefore surprising that the draft budget released just this month for 2020 assumes oil exports will average around 1 million barrels per day this number is pure fantasy and the regime knows it we should expect to see an enormous budget deficit this year the regime is also facing a domestic crisis with some of the worst protests in its 40 year history the public were livid that the IRGC lied to them for three days about shooting down a passenger jet which killed 176 people Four Iranian state television anchors and actors resigned over the last week One state tv newscaster wrote to her followers forgive me for the 13 years i told you lies the regime has elections coming up next month and these elections are a charade of the 247 sitting parliamentarians running for re election 90 were disqualified by an unelected Guardian Council the same council also disqualified 9,000 of the total 14,000 candidates the Iranian people know they have little to say in these sham elections which are meant to deceive the world that Iran is a republic and not an autocracy and finally Iran is facing a diplomatic crisis as its isolation deepens we were pleased to see the United Kingdom France and Germany initiate the Iran nuclear deal dispute resolution mechanism earlier this week prime minister Johnson called to replace the Iran nuclear deal with a new deal which we very much support Yesterday president Rouhani made veiled threats against European troops Today the supreme leader Khamenei lashed out against Europe for standing up to Iran 's nuclear blackmail as long as the regime threatens the world it will become further isolated until Iran behaves like a normal nation its isolation will only deepen happy to take a few questions ms ortagus Matt go ahead question First let me just say that the removal of these screens here is ms ortagus i know i saw you looking question it 's an improvement ms ortagus oh it 's an improvement Laughter question yes ms ortagus i thought you did n't like my prompters inaudible question no no i do n't no it was just they got in the they got in the way now i have a mr hook a clear line of sight a target Laughter ms ortagus thank you question look at you guys Laughter question yeah One on the designation mr hook yeah question can you be more specific about what the tip information was was it like video showing this guy directing the massacre or can you what was what form was it was it mr hook well one question and how did you corroborate it mr hook we received the videos of the massacre in that town and we also so what we do is we take information which comes in the form of photos and videos and text and then we corroborate it against our own intelligence that we have until we have sufficient evidence to make the decision question okay but you ca n't be more specific about what i mean what did the pictures or video show did it show this guy directing mr hook well the videos have shown well i 'm not going to get into the specifics of it but we do have video which i think the public has seen of these trucks that have gun mounts and they were mowing down Iranians and at that that massacre alone killed well over 100 people question Secondly there is a report that you guys threatened the e3 with auto tariffs if they did n't invoke the dispute mechanism resolution there seems to be some confusion about this is that true did you or someone else in the administration in this January 8th phone call with the e3 make that threat and then lastly later this month the remaining waivers for the nuclear cooperation expire can you give us some insight as to what the administration is thinking in terms of either revoking them or not renewing them or extending them and then last sorry Laughter this is for Morgan i want to can you come back to the podium after he 's finished and take a question or two ms ortagus not today but let 's go let 's get through we have to get off the stage pretty quickly because the secretary 's speaking so let 's try to mr hook on the question about auto tariffs we do n't comment on bilateral deliberations so i do n't have any comment i ca n't confirm or deny it question well but this is not bilateral this was four mr hook well you can call it quadrilateral but we do n't comment on those sorts of things and we also do n't preview decisions on things like waivers MS ortagus Nadia question thank you The UK Government has now listed Hizballah as a terrorist organization both political and military wing is this in coordination with the U.S. is this as a pressure you pressured the UK Government how do you see that mr hook well we 'd like to congratulate the United Kingdom for announcing today that it has designated the entire Hizballah organization as a terrorist group and frozen its assets there is no distinction between Hizballah 's political arm and its military arm i remember when i was negotiating with the e3 on trying to fix the deficiencies of the Iran nuclear deal this was a regular topic of the need to be designating Hizballah in its entirety we are very pleased to see the United Kingdom took that step ms ortagus Said question yes thank you sir in an interview yesterday with Orient Television you stated four points for a new deal One of them no enrichment whatsoever mr hook mm hmm question now we 're a bit confused on this because there is nothing in the UN whatever discussions and so on that dictates that there should be no enrichment for Iran whatsoever uranium enrichment mr hook well the UN Security Council in i 'm going to say 2006 2007 passed a resolution prohibiting Iran from enrichment that is the UN standard that the Iran nuclear deal abandoned and that was a mistake and so what secretary Pompeo announced in May of 2018 with his 12 demands is that the world needs to restore the standard of no enrichment which was passed unanimously by the UN Security Council it should never have been given away in negotiations with the Iranians on the Iran nuclear deal and so we think that 's the right standard and if you 're able to accomplish that it moots the question of breakout cycles and once you then allow enrichment you start having these discussions about breakout cycles and so the United Arab Emirates we think showed leadership in the region during the Bush administration when we negotiated the 123 agreement where the UAE has peaceful nuclear power without any enrichment More than half of the countries in the world today that have peaceful nuclear power do not enrich and so the Iranian regime knows that it does not need enrichment if it wants peaceful nuclear power we need to restore the standard ms ortagus Humeyra question Khamenei today said IRGC could easily take the fight beyond Iran 's borders and obviously we 've seen a lot of attacks in the region what is your response to those who say that your maximum pressure is making Iran more aggressive and since you wo n't change course on that should the region brace for more hostilities in the coming months mr hook well there have been always been hostilities in the region so the question suggests that things have been quiet before we targeted Qasem Soleimani so Iran has been running an escalatory expansionist foreign policy for 40 years they 're not used to being told no and president Trump is standing up to them in ways that have no historic precedent the regime does n't like it and so we 're not surprised to see the threats that the supreme leader makes this is standard talking points for the regime but what we saw after the Soleimani strike that Iran said that this concludes the retaliation for Qasem Soleimani they appear to be standing down for now but we have the combination of maximum economic pressure and restoring deterrence by the credible threat of military force if attacked is going to do more to advance peace and stability in the region than a policy of accommodation with the regime Iran was able to run an expansionist foreign policy under the Iran nuclear deal their expansion was funded by the Iran nuclear deal ms ortagus Rich question Brian speaking of quadrilateral relationships the e3 did announce that they are triggering the dispute mechanism but they were also fairly clear that they are not joining maximum pressure and they are clear that they want to save this deal do you think that the e3 have gone far enough mr hook well the e3 will make a decision in their own sovereign capacity but there is n't much left for the deal there is n't much left to preserve the Iran deal has been violated five times by this regime and i think it was Zarif who said that they will no longer honor additional restrictions and so there is n't much left of the deal and it starts to expire in October we 're only 10 months away from the UN arms embargo on the world 's leading sponsor of terrorism expiring and so that will allow countries like Russia and China to sell conventional weapons to Iran and this is something which the UN Security Council is going to have to address initiating the dispute resolution mechanism could if brought to its logical conclusion lead to the snapback of UN sanctions but that 's going to be a decision that the e3 make the president has called on the e3 to leave the Iran nuclear deal and join his efforts to get to a new deal that we are highly confident will do much more to deter Iran from ever getting a nuclear weapon than the Iran nuclear deal so we need to as i said restore that standard of no enrichment and we also need to go beyond just the nuclear threat we need to look at the regional aggression the ballistic missile testing missile proliferation and hostage taking ms ortagus shaun question thanks i was wondering if you could provide clarity on recent reports regarding the U.S. relationship with the exiled opposition there have been a series of reports saying the United States has advised its embassies not to have contact with the MEK noting that they may not have the greatest support within Iran 's borders and that that had been superseded what 's the directive now are you comfortable with U.S. embassies and other American officials meeting with the exiled opposition what are the guidelines on that mr hook so our position our strategy for almost three years now has been to stand with the Iranian people and the most recent cable that went out made very clear that we encourage our embassies and posts around the world to actively engage with the Iranian diaspora Just last week i was in Los Angeles which is home to the world 's largest Iranian diaspora met with many of them gave a few speeches secretary Pompeo has met with the Iranian diaspora around the world so it 's very important to meet with them to hear their concerns and to share with them our strategy our foreign policy which has been very successful at weakening the regime and weakening its proxies and restoring deterrence and so that work will continue we 've been doing it for three years we do n't play favorites among groups we do n't as i 've said you 've heard me say before the future of Iran will be decided by the Iranian people it will not be decided by the United States Government there are a range of groups out there they are very passionate about the future of Iran so the Iranian people will decide its future ms ortagus Nike question yes thank you Brian do you have anything on the female defector the only Iranian female olympic medalist is the U.S. in touch with her and would the United States welcome her if she 's seeking asylum here mr hook i do n't know if she is seeking asylum so i ca n't speak to that Morgan did put out a statement at the time when she defected ms ortagus a tweet mr hook a tweet she put out here 's what i 'll observe all of so much of the strength and the energy in the anti regime protests are being led by Iranian women and she is another example of a woman showing great bravery and courage defecting from the regime she represents so many of the Iranian women who are forced to wear the hijab who whose basic rights are not respected and so it 's not a surprise that she left i 'm sure many more Iranian women would like to leave the oppression that this regime presents to them and so but take a look at what Morgan tweeted it was very good ms ortagus Kylie question i just want to ask about the briefing that was scheduled earlier this week for congressional committees on Iran that was then abruptly cancelled can you give us a reason for the cancellation and if it will be rescheduled mr hook that 's a question for our Legislative Affairs office i believe it was just simply a scheduling conflict there 's nothing more to it than that but leg affairs would have the best answer for you question and can i have one more question mr hook yeah question just with regard to the U.S. and Iran and any direct communications so earlier this week secretary Pompeo said it was not true that there 's no communication between the U.S. and Iran and we heard secretary Esper say that the ball is in Iran 's court with regard to the way forward so has the U.S. used these channels of communication in recent weeks to say to Iran we want direct communication between the U.S. and Iranians or is the ball in their court to prompt that conversation mr hook yeah i 've heard these rumors from a few people that there is no back channel there is no sort of the message that you described i 'm not aware of that and so we question sorry which message are you not aware of mr hook the one that you talked about i 'm just saying that that is n't true i 've heard the rumors they 're not true secretary Esper is correct the ball is in Iran 's court president Trump has been making clear for almost three years and so has secretary Pompeo about we would like to have our diplomacy met with diplomacy and not with kinetic action and that 's really a question for the Iranian regime they continually reject diplomatic off ramps and as a consequence they 're now facing a series of domestic crises that i laid out earlier MS ortagus okay we 're going to do last question ft question thank you you mentioned the people in Iran are blaming the government for the problems that they 're facing do you think that pressure will keep up and what will be the impact on Tehran and one extra one if i may does the U.S. have an assessment on what Iran 's nuclear breakout time is is it under a year and can you give us a little bit of precision about exactly how long you think it is mr hook on the first one we have seen protests against the Iranian regime in Iran Iraq and Lebanon and the peoples of these three countries are all protesting the same model of corruption and sectarian violence and we fully expect these protests to continue because the Iranian regime is facing a crisis of legitimacy and credibility we expect that to deepen in 2020 not just in Iran but in other states on the breakout your question kind of makes my point if we can get to no enrichment we do n't need to worry about breakout cycles and that really is the problem is once you concede that Iran can enrich you 're always going to be in this discussion of how strong is the inspections regime and how close are they to a nuclear breakout cycle if we can get to no enrichment which we need to do because Iran will never be allowed to get a nuclear weapon that is the best way to accomplish it ms ortagus okay mr hook and the specific answer is a question for our Intelligence Community MS ortagus thanks mr hook okay thanks ms ortagus see you guys soon"

"July 26, 2018",secretary pompeo good afternoon everyone since the earliest days of his presidency president Trump has directed his administration to advance and defend the rights of religious freedom at home and abroad because religious freedom is a universal god given right to which all people are entitled it is also an essential building block for all free societies ensuring religious freedom around the world is a key priority of the Trump administration 's foreign policy to that end today we concluded the first ever ministerial to advance religious freedom the success of this event was truly unbelievable the level of enthusiasm from partner groups and other governments was so high that i 've already committed to doing this again to holding the second ministerial a year from now This week we were joined by more than 80 foreign delegations and religious leaders from all across the world who work closely with civil society groups who are often on the frontlines of reporting and responding to cases of religious intolerance and persecution i want to thank the dozens of ministerial level foreign dignitaries that attended i interact professionally with them every day in the course of diplomacy but as a man of faith their presence this week was significant to me personally as well Two we had survivors of religious persecution with us sharing their stories and driving home why this work is so important the vice president and i had a chance to sit with a number of them and hear their stories to talk about why they were working in this field why religious freedom meant so much to them and also today vice president Pence gave a speech to bring attention to the plight of religious minorities of all faiths who are persecuted for what they believe often by their own governments the vice president also announced that in the coming months the United States Government will launch a genocide recovery and persecution response initiative this is a diplomatic and assistance effort specifically focused on ensuring communities of faith and local organizations are part of the solution in recovering from atrocities while focused first on our ongoing response to the genocide committed by ISIS in Iraq our hope is that this program will assist victims in many different places the department was also proud to host several other U.S. senior government officials to speak this week including senior advisor to the president Jared Kushner OMB director Mick Mulvaney and USAID administrator Mark Green and tonight UN ambassador Nikki Haley will be giving remarks we at the State Department are also undertaking several new initiatives to further the cause of religious freedom around the world First as the vice president announced this morning we 've created an International Religious Freedom Fund this is a joint fund with other nations that will support the work of religious freedom defenders and assist victims of religious persecution Second we have created a new International Visitor Leadership Program to bring those working on the frontlines of religious freedom issues together all different faiths from all around the world to come to the United States it 's a ten day project and will focus on promoting religious pluralism and protecting the rights of religious minorities if you are a champion of religious freedom be on the lookout for announcements coming soon Third in just a couple months the State Department will host a three day accelerated workshop called boldline to support and scale innovative public private partnerships that

"August 14, 2020",Today the Department of Justice announced the successful seizure of over one million barrels of Iranian gasoline intended for the illegitimate Maduro regime in Venezuela the proceeds from these shipments would have allegedly benefitted Iran 's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps IRGC a designated Foreign Terrorist Organization our diplomacy led by special representative for Iran Brian Hook was able to both halt these shipments and assist the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security in executing a U.S. seizure order for the gasoline cargo issued on July 2 2020 we note that the proceeds from the Iranian gasoline if successfully forfeited in U.S. courts could now support the U.S. Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Fund instead of those engaging in terrorism like the IRGC we are seeing more and more global shipping fleets avoiding the Iran venezuela trade due to our sanctions implementation and enforcement efforts The United States remains committed to our maximum pressure campaigns against the Iranian and Maduro regimes

"March 30, 2017",secretary tillerson in progress minister Cavusoglu and i am privileged to be visiting Turkey today a NATO ally and a friend of the United States in a very turbulent part of the world i met with president Erdogan and the foreign minister to convey president Trump 's commitment to strengthening the relationship between our two countries Today 's conversations built on three mutual long term goals working together to defeat Daesh ISIS building stability in the region and bolstering economic ties between our two nations Turkey 's been a NATO ally since 1952 and we continue to exercise military cooperation in that alliance and in the global coalition to defeat daesh our discussions today reaffirmed that we will prevent the resurgence of Daesh in previously held territory and aggressively stop the emergence of new terrorist threats on the ground as well as the recruitment of terrorists online over the past 18 months the U.S. Military 's ability to operate from Turkish bases has enabled us to increase operations against ISIS by 25 percent without the utilization of any additional aircraft required The Turkish Government has stopped the influx of foreign fighters into Iraq and Syria Turkish troops have permanently pushed ISIS off the Turkish Syria border and the United States is grateful for Turkey 's important contributions as a member of the counter isis coalition including the participation last week of foreign minister Cavusoglu at the recent coalition meetings hosted by the State Department in Washington we stand alongside Turkey in their fight to stop terrorism directed against its country and its people the PKK attacks in Turkey last year remind us of how close to home the threat of attack is for the Turkish people we extend our condolences for all those who have been lost who have lost those with loved ones to PKK terror and we mourn the more than 70 Turkish lives lost inside of Syria in the brave fight against Daesh Turkey has shown leadership by helping to alleviate the ongoing refugee crisis stemming from the conflict in Syria in four years Turkey has accommodated more than 3 million refugees from Syria Iraq and Afghanistan and done much to provide them food shelter health care and education we look to Turkey as a key partner for stabilization effort in areas once held by ISIS and for ensuring our NGO and UN partners can continue to provide humanitarian relief services inside and outside of Syria we commend Turkey for its efforts to find a peaceful solution to the nearly six year Syrian conflict i also came here to deepen our countries trade and investment ties bilateral trade and goods between our two countries was more than $ 17 billion in 2016 and we 're eager to grow that number American and Turkish scientists collaborate on research to improve energy efficiency health and education under the framework of the U.S.-Turkey Science and Technology Agreement and we 're also fostering public private partnerships that support technology based innovation and entrepreneurship we will work with the Turkish Government and the private sector to expand economic cooperation that benefits both of our countries The United States and Turkey share many broad goals for the region reducing Iran 's ability to disrupt the region finding a settlement in Syria that allows Syrians to return home and supporting Iraqis to build a strong independent and inclusive government in Baghdad in the United States the people of Turkey have a trusted ally and a partner who is committed to its safety and security and advancing economic opportunity we look forward to approaching these challenges together and the Trump administration will continue to build ties with this longstanding ally and our friend and i thank the foreign minister for his hospitality today question in Turkish secretary tillerson well those were the subjects of our conversations today to have an exchange of views regarding the most the best way forward to secure areas inside of Syria create zones of stabilization to allow the return of people to Syria and to set the stage for a longer term political solution i think the exchange of views was very helpful to both of us today and we will continue to work together on the way forward in terms of the future of Raqqa we look forward to the liberation of Raqqa and the return of its control to local to its local citizens its authorities and to putting it under local control for security so that all of the Syrians who had to flee that area can return question thank you mr. secretary how do you convince the Turkish Government that partnering with Kurdish YPG rebels is essential in defeating ISIS when the government here calls that partnership an unacceptable one with a terrorist group and mr. foreign minister your governor has been highly critical of the United States over the arrest of Mehmet Atilla this week saying you should have at least received advance notice of it how has that impacted your discussions here today and how do you respond to charges that Americans like pastor Andrew Brunson are being arrested here to be used as a bargaining chip for the extradition of Pastor Gulen foreign minister cavusolglu can you repeat the first thing that i could n't get the first thing that question Andrew Brunson foreign minister cavusoglu Andrew Brunson and who else question the arrest of Andrew Brunson oh Mehmet Atilla his arrest in the United States foreign minister cavusoglu oh okay question thank you secretary tillerson well as i indicated in the previous response to the question we had a very good discussion and conversation today both at the prime minister 's level and the president around an exchange of views of how best to secure areas going forward in Syria we 're exploring a number of options and alternatives and we had a good discussion around those and there 's additional i think consideration on both sides yet to come foreign minister cavusoglu in Turkish secretary tillerson in response to the question regarding the notification that is certainly the intent on the part of the consul office here is to advise anyone when there 's been a change of status of their visa if we 're able to reach them so that is a normal procedure foreign minister cavusoglu in Turkish question yes good afternoon Lesley Wroughton from Reuters this is a question for secretary Tillerson the minister said that the that you that the United States has admitted there 's no difference between the YPG and the PKK do you believe that you have overcome your differences over this issue and that you can move forward concretely in Syria in the fight to retake Raqqa given if you 've overcome those differences the other question i have is the previous administration said that Syrian president Assad must go Nikki Haley said yesterday that the fight in Syria can not move forward without the issue of Assad being resolved how do you see that issue being moved forward as you move more aggressively on Raqqa secretary tillerson well again i think on the question of how to carry forward with the defeat of Daesh ISIS in Syria let there be no mistake just so we can be clear there is no space between Turkey and the United States in our commitment to defeat Daesh to defeat ISIS not just in Syria and Iraq but as members of the greater coalition to defeat Daesh anywhere Daesh shows its face on planet Earth they will be confronted by the coalition to defeat them on the battlefield as well as in the cyberspace and in the social media space so in terms of the tactics that are necessary to achieve that outcome that is why we meet that is why we meet with our very important partners here as well as other very important coalition members who are engaged directly in the military activities in Iraq and Syria so there is more discussion yet to be had regarding the way forward what we discussed today were options that are available to us they are difficult options let me be very frank these are not easy decisions they are difficult choices that have to be made so this has been very good the conversations today were very frank very candid and we will be taking those conversations away i know the foreign minister and the president and the prime minister they will consider all of the exchanges we had today but ultimately Turkey and the United States will stay together in the fight as part of the broader coalition to defeat Daesh question about president Assad should he stay or should he go secretary tillerson i think the status and the longer term status of president Assad will be decided by the Syrian people

"May 16, 2019",question Mike Pompeo is the U.S. secretary of State and he is my guest here on The Guy Benson Show mr. secretary thank you first of all for having me along on your trip to Brussels and Sochi and thanks for doing the show secretary pompeo it was great to have you with us i hope you learned something from the trip and benefitted from it question no doubt no doubt so as we were landing at Andrews Air Force Base yesterday morning the news was breaking that the State Department was ordering all nonessential personnel out of U.S. diplomatic missions in Iraq also a long planned diplomatic security summit had been postponed all of that was related to intensifying threats from Iran so it became clear to me there why you chose to divert the beginning of our trip to Brussels where you met with your E3 counterparts on that issue can you tell us a bit more about how and why the administration reached the decision to take those actions secretary pompeo Guy i ca n't say much about the intelligence proper but all should know that there is real data that underlies the risks that we 've identified that caused us to make these decisions as for the process at the State Department we have a detailed process we talk about in terms of how we make sure to keep American diplomats safe what risks we 're prepared to take how we defend ourselves and we concluded given the escalating risk in the region that it made sense for us to get those nonessential personnel out of Iraq question there 's something of a media narrative that seems to be congealing that this is part of the Trump administration 's sort of effort to goad Iran into war and i think that 's cynical i think that 's unfair i also understand that a lot of Americans have a sensitivity to these issues that sort of relate to intelligence gathering and potential armed conflict i know that you ca n't get into too much of the intelligence as you just said but are there any additional details about the nature of the threat metrics matrix that you 've been seeing from Iran in the last few days and can you comment at all on the New York Times report this morning that it may have been related to or some of this may have been related to new images of sea based missiles from Iran secretary pompeo it 's important for everyone to understand that this is 40 years of aggression by the Islamic Republic of Iran so to put it into just three days or five days or seven days takes out of context the threat and the desires of the Islamic Republic of Iran and so all of this is part and parcel of the challenge of a revolutionary regime that wants the Great Satan and Israel to go away and so you have to take the data set along with right it 's always about capability and will demonstrated will ill will against the United States of America and so the things that you see and i ca n't comment on the New York Times story other than to say the things that you 've seen us do to attempt to achieve deterrence against the Islamic Republic of Iran from their malign activity is a direct response to eight years of an administration that allowed the terror regime to expand right during the JCPOA we had increased missile capabilities coming out of Iran we had their capacity to deliver harm from Houthi rebels in Yemen all of these things Iran did happened because the previous administration appeased the Islamic Republic of Iran so we are pushing back and when you push back tension does increase our mission set is very clear we know what we 're asking the Iranian leadership to do and we are very focused on achieving that and we 're trying to do so in a way that makes sure that we keep every American diplomat and every American soldier sailor airman and Marine safe as well question holding intelligence close to the vest is something with which you 're quite familiar because before you took this current job you were the director of the CIA i 'm curious how you compare these two gigs is there anything that you might prefer about being secretary of State anything that you miss about leading the CIA secretary pompeo they 're very different roles and i have enjoyed each of them a great deal they require different skillsets from a leadership perspective they deliver very different very different answers for the president of the United States One is fact based designed truly to ensure that the president of the United States and the senior leadership in the United States government have the best most timely information of any leadership team in the world here the president is asking me for how to take that data set and apply it against America 's interests how do we achieve outcomes that are protective of America 's citizens keeping us safe and growing our economy Two very different jobs i have been privileged to hold each of them and love them both question speaking of American interests you 've just returned from Russia where you met with your counterpart the foreign minister Sergey Lavrov and also the Russian president Vladimir Putin i think we all know about the tensions and the challenges between our two countries they 're pretty obvious the election interference Ukraine Venezuela but on the trip you frequently returned to this refrain about what you called overlapping interests so i think a lot of Americans are deeply suspicious of Moscow for legitimate reasons but can you maybe give some examples of discrete issues on which working with the Russians actually is in our interest secretary pompeo you bet i certainly can look each of us and you saw this on the trip each of our nations is doing its best to protect is own interests president Trump certainly has directed me to do everything we can to push back against any country including Russia where it threatens an American interest but i 'll give you a couple of examples Today in Afghanistan we 're working to try and achieve reconciliation there Russia sits very close to Afghanistan and has a terror threat that can emanate from that region in the same way that the United States has a terror threat that may emanate there 's an overlap if we can achieve a reduction in violence there we could do good for each of our two countries North Korea another example the Russians have an interest too in ensuring that there are n't loose nuclear materials floating around in the region they share a border with the North Koreans they have an interest in helping the North Korean economy be successful once it 's denuclearized so there are places there too where we not only can but have worked closely together when i was the CIA director we worked on counterterrorism all around the world passing information about terror threats between our two countries i know for certain we kept Americans safe as a result of information that the Russians provided us and i know we 've saved Russian lives with information that we had in our possession so there 's goodness three examples of discrete places where we it makes real sense for the United States and Russia to work together question so one of the most memorable moments of the trip for me was when Putin walked into the room and just seeing him in the flesh was sort of a moment and he made these brief opening comments before you had that private meeting that lasted about an hour and a half in those public comments with the press still in the room Putin unsolicited raised the issue of the Mueller report he called Mueller 's findings exotic and then a few breaths later said that he thought the investigation was objective i 'm just wondering were you surprised that he brought it up the way that he did and how he characterized the Mueller report secretary pompeo oh goodness very little surprises me these days Guy so no i ca n't say i was terribly surprised that the president Putin 's view on the Mueller report was n't what i 'd gone there for we went there for a very substantive set of conversations which we were able to successfully have but i think he was pointing to this issue of collusion sort of the core finding from the Mueller report i think he had felt burdened by that and that he feels as though president Trump was burdened by that as well so i think in that sense he was saying hey the deck the idea that somehow there had been direct collusion between president Trump and the campaign and the Russian leadership the fact that the Mueller report dispelled that i think he found useful as a turning point to try and find a better way for conversations between our two countries i think that was his core point question a major one of the major issues mr. secretary that came up in your meetings according to Lavrov and yourself was Venezuela and you held a press conference with the foreign minister i asked a question about Venezuela and Lavrov sort of launched into this whole in my view tendentious answer with about history and sort of deflecting blame onto the U.S. and suggesting that it 's Maduro 's opponents that are the true villains in this i guess i was n't terribly surprised to hear that spin coming from the Russians although it was kind of galling to see it in person but i was struck that some of that some of that moral inversion if you will sounded a bit like some of the commentary we 've heard from some elected officials here at home including a Democratic member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee what 's your reaction when you hear what amounts to pro maduro propaganda frankly from some American politicians secretary pompeo yeah i 'm bothered when the Russians do it i am deeply troubled when Americans do it look we know the facts in Venezuela pretty clearly we have a regime that has destroyed the lives of millions of Venezuelan people it 's a country that 's not a poor country by necessity but rather a poor country as a result of failed leadership and a failed economic model and looting and corruption The United States effort to assist the Venezuelan people achieve their democracy is pure in its objectives right we are truly a force for good in Venezuela today i can prove it with the 300 metric tons of food sitting on the border waiting to go in and provide medicine to sick children and food to those kids who are starving so when i do hear when i hear an American sort of blame the United States for the situation in Venezuela it 's both factually wrong and sickening and i regret it the best solution is to fight back with facts and the good news is there has been a bipartisan consensus on Venezuela that we are in fact there for the right reasons and that our mission set there is important and noble question question about the president he recently suggested that one of your predecessors from the previous administration John Kerry should possibly be prosecuted under the Logan Act for Kerry 's reported ongoing back channels with the Iranians critics say that 's undermining the Trump administration 's tougher policy on Iran senator Marco Rubio of Florida just this week called for a formal investigation into Kerry 's conduct on that front as the sitting secretary of State what do you make of all of that secretary pompeo it is ahistorical and completely unhelpful when previous secretaries of State are continuing to engage in the tasks that they engaged in when they were the secretary of State i 'll leave it at that in the sense of it 's time to get off the stage for the previous administration i understand they have different views than we have they are entitled to those views but talking with senior leaders around the world and suggesting to them somehow that waiting out this administration is the best course of action for those countries is something that is unheard of it is fundamentally different than any previous administration has undertaken and they ought to leave the foreign policy to us and then do their best to get folks with foreign policy views that have appeased the Iranians that allowed chairman Kim Jong un to continue to advance his nuclear threat that put us prostrate around the world if those are the policies they want they should go fight for them at the ballot box question finally kind of a personal question here and it 's something that came to me as we were on this trip together to Brussels and to Sochi i think a lot of Americans from a distance kind of intuitively understand that your job requires tons and tons of travel and there 's constant high level meetings but i 'm not even sure that i understood how grueling your schedule can be until i experienced it firsthand with you and that was just three days i was ready to tap out after the third day i 'm like all right this is a lot wow and that was after really a week of a lot of traveling for you all over the world your team was telling me on the plane that one of the things that you loathe more than anything in the world is being away from your wife so i 'm wondering how has your family adjusted to this breakneck pace and the near constant travel that the position requires and how are you trying to i do n't know mitigate some of that strain that 's sort of inherent in the job secretary pompeo look i welcome that question it 's interesting that my team said that it 's true i 'm very blessed to have a wonderful wife and a son who 's a huge supporter as well they 've been awesome they keep me emboldened when i need it and humble when i deserve it and they just truly understand that this is a time of service for our family we have this incredible privilege to serve America and to serve the Constitution and president Trump and they have done everything they can to help me be as successful as i can be in this role i try when i 'm back here to get home in the evening in time to spend a little bit of time with my wife before i go back to reading and we try to get to church and do all the things that are normal in the Pompeo family life so that we do n't become too disconnected from the world that we loved so much before we had this incredible opportunity question yeah but i mean it really is nonstop around the clock secretary pompeo yes sir it 's a big job but i signed up for it voluntarily no complaints and i 'm going to keep working hard until the day comes when i 'm no longer in it question well we appreciate that very much we also really appreciate your time secretary Mike Pompeo U.S. secretary of State thank you sir for joining the Guy Benson Show secretary pompeo thank you sir thanks for joining me on the trip Guy question it was my pleasure secretary pompeo you bet sir so long question thank you mr. secretary SECRETARY pompeo yep Guy thank you have a great day question you too

Hong Kong based Triliance Petrochemical and Hong Kong entity Jiaxiang Industry Hong Kong Limited for knowingly engaging in a significant transaction for the purchase acquisition sale or transport of petrochemical products from Iran pursuant to executive order e.o. 13846 we are also imposing sanctions on two of the executive officers of the companies identified above Ali Bayandarian managing director of Triliance Petrochemical and Zhiqing Wang chairman and legal representative of Shandong Qiwangda Petrochemical Co. Ltd. in addition to these actions the Department of the Treasury is also designating Triliance Petrochemical Hong Kong entity Sage Energy HK Limited Chinese entity Peakview Industry Co. and UAE entity Beneathco DMCC for assisting or supporting the previously sanctioned National Iranian Oil Company NIOC pursuant to E.O. 13846 these entities have collectively transferred hundreds of millions of dollars to NIOC which has been instrumental in financing Iran 's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Qods Force IRGC QF and the terrorist groups and militias around the Middle East that it supports the entities targeted today continued to facilitate Iran 's petrochemical and petroleum exports contrary to U.S. sanctions all entities and individuals in the petrochemical sector should take notice The United States will not waver in its commitment to sanctions enforcement as long as the Iranian regime continues to exploit revenue from its petroleum and petrochemical industries to fund destabilizing activities we will sanction any entity or individual that facilitates such trade the Iranian regime must cease its destabilizing activities or it will continue to face even greater economic pressure and diplomatic isolation our sanctions will remain in place until Iran changes its behavior we will continue to expose the regime 's malign activities self dealing and outright oppression
"May 27, 2020",ms ortagus thank you so much and thanks everybody for the second call of the day late in the afternoon early evening i guess at this point appreciate everybody getting on Earlier today as you saw the secretary announced his decision to end the sanctions waiver covering all remaining jcpoa originating nuclear projects in Iran and also sanctioned two Iranian nuclear officials as the secretary noted the Iranian regime has continued its nuclear brinkmanship by expanding proliferation sensitive activities this of course is a complicated and multifaceted decision and we wanted to make sure and give you access to the best thinking behind it which is why i 'm joined today by our special representative for Iran and senior policy advisor to the secretary Brian Hook and our assistant secretary for International Security and nonproliferation Chris Ford assistant secretary Ford and special representative hook will provide brief introductory remarks and then we 'll be able to answer your questions please note that even though this call is on the record the briefings are embargoed until the end of the call just a reminder to go ahead and get in our question queue dial 1 and then 0 Brian first then Chris mr hook thank you Morgan Today secretary Pompeo terminated the nuclear waiver for three remaining Iran nuclear related projects this includes the Arak reactor conversion the provision of enriched uranium for the Tehran research reactor and the export of Iran spent and scrap research reactor fuel the decision will take effect after a 60 day wind down secretary Pompeo extended a waiver for the Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant for 90 days international assistance a Bushehr predates the Iran nuclear deal the secretary retains the right to revoke or modify this waiver at any time in light of the Iranian regime 's ongoing expansion of its proliferation sensitive nuclear activities we can not justify extending the waiver for these activities beyond the wind down period in addition secretary Pompeo announced the designation of Amjad Sazgar and Majid Agha'i for supporting Iran 's proliferation of weapons of mass destruction in 2019 Sazgar managed and supervised the installation of centrifuges at Iran 's Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant he also managed uranium centrifuge activities that have contributed to Iran exceeding its enriched uranium stockpile in excess of its nuclear deal commitments agha'i has also been centrally involved in Iran 's uranium enrichment centrifuge operations and is a manager in the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran subsidiary that is responsible for research and development of advanced centrifuges as a result of this action today these two individuals have been added to Treasury 's SDN list we are taking these actions now because the regime continues to use its nuclear program to extort the international community the Iranian regime 's threats are designed to intimidate nations into accepting Iran 's usual violent behavior for fear of something worse we refuse to play by Iran 's rules president Trump 's maximum pressure campaign has constrained and countered Iran in unprecedented ways we have deprived the clerical rulers of vast amounts of revenue we have disrupted their financial networks and their sectarian networks because of our pressure Iran 's leaders are facing a decision either negotiate with us or manage economic collapse Iran 's economy is especially grim because the autocratic rule of the ayatollahs has proven to be an economic catastrophe for the Iranian people exports are down the economy is in deep contraction the budget the government budget is facing unprecedented pressures it can not fix and access to foreign reserves is minimal The United States will continue its successful strategy of maximum economic pressure and diplomatic isolation at the same time we will deny Iran all paths to a nuclear weapon just recently Iran 's supreme leader publicly invoked the final solution which is to endorse the Nazi policy of genocide against the Jews his regime was condemned widely as it should be but it underscores the very real threat this regime poses no country that threatens to annihilate Israel or any nation should be allowed the means to do so The United States stands with Israel and many other partners around the world in ensuring Iran never develops a nuclear weapon we have taken another step in that direction today with our decisions regarding Iran 's nuclear program i will now turn it over to my colleague acting under secretary Chris Ford ASSISTANT secretary FORD thanks Brian i do n't have much to add but i do want to remind the listeners of the trajectory that this has come along over the last year or so as you all recall there were basically quite a larger number of projects that had begun under the JCPOA for which U.S. waivers were in place and those waivers have gradually been taken down one by one with this as the latest step in that progression as you might recall there were there was originally a U.S. sanction waiver applying to Iran 's production and export of heavy water for which it has no use but which it has continued to produce a project that originally began in connection with the effort to build a plutonium production reactor moderated by heavy water there was also a waiver for a uranium swap mechanism under which the Iranians were designed to allow the Iranians to continue to produce low enriched uranium without exceeding their jcpoa caps because as they would come up to that cap it could be swapped out abroad for natural uranium that was not so enriched there was also a waiver that applied to a project at a place called Fordow which was to permit the construction of a stable isotope project using uranium or using centrifuges not using uranium using centrifuges in that project in one of the tunnels that Iran had dug into a mountain some years before as part of its illicit nuclear weapons effort there was also there were also a number of additional waivers that were in place for a while the remainder of them are now coming off as Brian mentioned there is fuel supply for the Tehran research reactor a scrap removal provision for the Tehran research reactor and a project for the redesign of the Arak nuclear reactor those last three are now coming off with the 60 day wind down that Brian mentioned we are however continuing as he indicated to keep in place our willingness to allow safety and other operations work in connection with the first unit at the Bushehr nuclear reactor as well as fuel supply and fuel take back for that reactor but as we clarified a couple of rounds ago in this our sanctions waiver does not extend to work on any additional units that might be constructed at Bushehr we are willing to continue countenancing the Bushehr reactor but we are not of the view that Iran should be getting any additional nuclear reactors so that 's the inaudible of the waiver progression the latest step of which is being announced today with regard to the two individuals that Brian mentioned on whom sanctions are going to be imposed i should note that these are State Department authorities that we are using under executive order 13382 and that the Treasury Department is probably even as we speak taking steps to add those two gentlemen to the list of specially designated nationals under the U.S. sanctions authority that 's all i 've got and i 'm sure we will be happy to try to answer your questions as best we can ms ortagus great thanks so much Chris and Brian we again just dial 1 and 0 if you want to get in the queue and i think up first we have Courtney McBride Wall Street Journal question thanks how long does the administration think it would take Iran to go back to the prior configuration for the arak reactor after this wind down period and then separately have there been any efforts to coordinate with the e3 on an arms embargo and what work has been going on on the draft that the administration has circulated that you 've referred to previously Brian thanks assistant secretary FORD shall i go first Brian mr hook Chris you want to take yeah you go first i 'll take the second one assistant secretary FORD the arak reactor project our assessment at this point is that going back to the original design would take them quite a few years and a great deal of money that frankly for the reasons that Brian outlined frankly they do n't have right now it 's also not entirely clear they have the expertise in country to do this on their own there have been persistent rumors that they may have gotten some foreign assistance the first time around and we would obviously have a high priority to ensure that that did not occur if they were to try to go back to that original design but it would take a great deal of time they originally started talking about this reactor in the early 2000s and they were all over the map in terms of projecting an operational date it was reported at one point that they would be going up in the late 2000s that obviously did n't occur it actually was n't terribly advanced at the time of the nuclear deal and at this point it is even less advanced because the calandria at the reactor vessel core has been as part of the redesign project extracted and filled with concrete so they would be starting from scratch and this would take them quite a bit of time it 's also worth pointing out that going for a trying to produce a plutonium production reactor in Iran would be an extraordinarily provocative thing to do in addition of course to taking lots of time and costing lots and lots of money so far Iran has been notably measured in building up its nuclear capabilities even in even though these are violations of its jcpoa commitments Iran does not seem to wish to antagonize the remaining participants in the jcpoa the european 3 Russia and China they do n't want to provoke a full snapback of UN Security Council sanctions and a complete resumption of full bore international economic pressures upon the Iranian regime and so it 's been fairly measured in its responses even on other aspects and so going back to the full scale pursuit of a plutonium production reactor would be an extraordinary provocation that i think is relatively unlikely for them to undertake even if they had the money with which to do so and it 's also true that no one can forget what happened the last time someone tried to build a plutonium production reactor in the Middle East in Syria which was of course destroyed by the Israelis in 2007 mr hook i know you also asked about the arms embargo president Rouhani recently went on television and declared that quote Iran will give a crushing response if the arms embargo on Tehran is extended this is yet another example of how the Iran nuclear deal has failed to moderate the regime we believe the Security Council has to reject Rouhani 's extortion we will we are pressing ahead with diplomacy we are working methodically to build support in the Council to extend the embargo we have drafted a resolution we certainly hope it will pass and our efforts are focused on securing passage in the Council i do n't have anything to say about confidential bilateral discussions with our European allies other than to say that they continue ms ortagus great thanks now next in the queue we have John Hudson Washington Post question hi thanks a lot One question just for Brian you mentioned the recent statement from Iran that as evidence that the Iran nuclear deal has n't moderated the regime but i mean at what point do you begin taking ownership for how Iran is responding because obviously the Trump administration 's Iran policy has been in place for a long time and it seems like there 's some selective picking and choosing about what is a result of the maximum pressure campaign and what is a lingering result of the Obama administration nuclear deal and i was just wondering the second question what was the reaction like from European officials when you guys consulted with them on this decision mr hook do n't have anything to say about discussions with allies which are confidential and should remain so i am in regular touch with my E3 counterparts on the first question it is true to say that the Iran nuclear deal did not moderate the Iranian regime 's behavior and that was one of the premises you can see it in the preambular language of the Iran nuclear deal itself that the deal would contribute to regional peace and stability instead we have seen the Iran nuclear deal come at the expense of peace and stability in the Middle East because it gave an incentive for nations to look the other way on Iran 's non nuclear threats which include ballistic missile testing missile and rocket proliferation regional aggression and hostage taking we put in place a policy after a comprehensive review of Iran 's threats and this is early on in the administration and we then put in place an entirely new approach to Iran that is the right formula of maximum pressure diplomatic isolation and credible military deterrent these are the three necessary ingredients to have a successful Iran policy and we have been unwavering in our commitment to implementing that and as a consequence the regime by most economic metrics is much weaker today than it was three years ago that 's as i said in my earlier remarks largely a function of the mismanagement of the economy by successive ayatollahs but it 's also because our sanctions have really dried up the revenue that the regime historically would otherwise spend supporting its proxies in the gray zone across the Middle East so we have never claimed to have eliminated Iran 's asymmetric capabilities that is the nature of modern terrorism there is always that asymmetric capability and terrorism on the cheap is not something that anybody any nation can eliminate but we have deterred and disrupted Iranian operations now for a number of years and the regime is facing its worst economic crisis in its 41 year history president Rouhani himself said that our sanctions have cost the regime $ 200 billion and they understand our strategy they 're not used to being told no they do n't like our policy but to us that 's just another metric that it 's working assistant secretary FORD if i could add to that one could argue about the degree to which their behavior has been moderated in kind but i think it is quite clear that it has been constrained to some really non trivial and quite important degree in practice that $ 200 billion that Brian mentioned is no trivial sum and it was n't that long ago if you 'll recall that Iranian sort of adventurous proxies in the Middle East were would brag to the media about all the limitless supplies of support of money that they were getting from the Iranian regime but in the last year or so they 've changed their tune and there have been some actually you can look this up online if you 'd like there have been some very public complaints about how those sources of funding have been dramatically cut back in recent months so i think Iran 's ability to act upon its still unfortunately demonstrably bad intentions has been much more constrained than before we are forcing them to make tradeoffs they did n't have to make and i think unless and until they come to the table to negotiate the kind of solution that we need with them that will certainly continue but forcing them to make those tradeoffs is i think very much a good thing for peace and stability in the Middle East MS ortagus great thanks guys next we have Lara Jakes New York Times question as i understand it allowing the work on these three sites had given international companies and officials more kind of eyes on visibility on what was happening inside and i 'm just wondering in that way does n't this decision remove those safeguards that sought to ensure that Iran could n't violate the deal assistant secretary FORD i would n't say that these particular projects provided any particular visibility the were there to have been scrap removal from the TRR that would have been a one time transaction to bring out some bits and pieces of metal the fuel supply has actually already taken place and the TRR is already in no need of fuel for quite some time to come potentially for years depending upon the burn rate that they have the reactor at and as for the Arak project it has n't progressed so far beyond really what is more than a glorified series of committee meetings so i think actually the delta there that you 're referring to is really quite negligible what is important is the continued visibility provided by the International Atomic Energy Agency and its safeguards inspectors into what the Iranian nuclear program is doing and we are of course strongly committed to continuing to support the IAEA and make sure that the rest of the international community joins as one in voicing support for the IAEA doing its job and making it very clear that Iran has legal obligations to allow IAEA inspectors to have access and get the information that they need in order to do that job and that when Iran denies those access requests and those requests for information as it has been doing as the director general of the agency has reported to the board of governors in Vienna it 's incumbent upon all of us to make sure that the integrity of the safeguard system is preserved but that 's the visibility that is critical here and i hope that despite Iranian denials of access and information we can all pull together and make sure that the signal is sent to them that they do not and must not have the option of treating their legal obligations and their safeguards obligations as options ms ortagus great thank you we have Andrea Mitchell NBC question hi there thanks for doing this just looking forward how much is Iran 's aggressive behavior militarily playing into this and how much is it the nuclear proliferation i mean how are you disaggregating the issues that have led you to this state this stage mr hook let me just give a brief answer and then ask Chris we have from the very beginning we have not siloed Iran 's threats to peace and security what we 've done is take a comprehensive approach to all of them and we seek a truly comprehensive deal not comprehensive in name only a truly comprehensive deal that addresses Iran 's nuclear threats missile regional aggression the hostage taking and so i ca n't say that there is Andrea one particular sort of motive for these actions today it 's a comprehensive approach that we have always taken and we work across various platforms in the State Department and across the interagency to have a very synchronized and coordinated approach we think that by doing it in this way and not putting all of our chips on one aspect sort of one threat that Iran presents it 's been a much more successful effort assistant secretary FORD sure i would n't add much to that except to point out that while there were some of the these projects had a direct potential impact upon increasing Iran 's level of nuclear knowledge in ways that we thought were not proliferation responsible such as the excuse that the fuel swap the very first of the waivers one of the first waivers to come off the excuse that the fuel swap gave them to continue enrichment activity that we felt they had no business being involved in doing in the first place the heavy water program for example there 's no use for that in Iran so it was simply a way for the Iranian nuclear industry to make some money and to help keep some of its people employed that was n't a project we felt it was worth associating ourselves with there were concerns about in various ways the ways in which these projects could over time increase the aggregate amount of Iranian nuclear knowledge but the fundamental point is really more basic than that it is simply that as a point of principle at a time when Iran has been building up their capabilities in ways that we consider to be very provocative and destabilizing we simply i think it was the secretary 's decision very clearly to dissociate ourselves from being willing to countenance that kind of engagement MS ortagus thanks Chris and Brian we are at the end of our question queue we would have time for one more if anyone else gets in the queue you dial 1 and 0 Ruben do we have anyone else that 's jumped on for a question mr harutunian Arshad Mohammed Reuters MS ortagus great question hi Two questions One why not terminate the waiver that allows the Russians to continue to work on Bushehr i get that the Bushehr project predates the JCPOA but the Bushehr project has also been a matter of concern for successive U.S. governments for more than a decade why not just cut that off and secondly you both have made repeated reference to Iran 's increasing its nuclear activities is it not the case though that much of if not all of that activity has been undertaken after the U.S. decision to withdraw from the JCPOA so on the one hand you say you wish to dissociate yourselves from that activity pursued by Iran but on the other hand one could inaudible ms ortagus arshad we lost you for a second mr hook we probably heard enough to have Chris take a swing at the answer ms ortagus okay go ahead ASSISTANT secretary FORD sure with respect to Bushehr i mean i should point out that we are what we are not announcing this week is that we will absolutely never under any circumstances change our course with respect to activities at that reactor these are on a 90 day cycle when the next cycle comes around the Bushehr waiver will be examined as before on its merits and we may or may not change course at that time so i would n't want to prejudge or assume any inaudible the secretary in advance of decisions that are actually made at the time on the basis of the facts of the moment so why not Bushehr we are continuing to assess the situation there at the moment we are willing to countenance operations there for purposes of safety and reactor operation probably a good thing for there not to be a reactor incident in Iran and also with respect to spent fuel supply sorry spent fuel take back and fuel supply to make sure that there is no reason for Iran to be claiming a need to enrich for Bushehr and no opportunity to use spent fuel to for the purposes of separating plutonium from it which could be of course redirected to a nuclear weapons program so for the moment we 're perfectly happy with the Bushehr project going forward although i would stress as we made clear earlier that our waiver does not apply

"December 1, 2017",special briefing senior state department official via teleconference December 1 2017 moderator good afternoon thank you for joining us for today 's call we 're pleased to have a senior State Department official here today to discuss on background the secretary 's upcoming travel to Europe for your reference and not for your reference and not for reporting we 'd like to welcome Senior State Department official from here forward Senior State Department official will be known as a senior State Department official he 's going to offer brief remarks at the top and then we 'll turn it over to you for questions senior STATE DEPARTMENT official well thank you for that introduction and thank you everyone for joining us this afternoon we are really excited for the secretary making what is his seventh trip to Europe since becoming secretary of State the secretary will travel to Belgium Austria and France this next week leaving on Monday and returning on Friday the purpose of this trip is really to reiterate America 's commitment to the transatlantic alliance and underscore a message to our allies and partners in Europe that the United States is committed to the defense not only of western institutions but also the West as a community of shared interests and values more broadly a lot of the themes we 're going to hit on this trip i think you see also in the secretary 's speech a few days ago at the Wilson Center he outlined an approach to Europe and some specific areas of focus and interest that these meetings will provide us an opportunity to follow up on in greater detail starting with Brussels the secretary will participate in a NATO foreign ministerial he 'll meet with EU high representative Mogherini have lunch with the EU 28 foreign ministers in a special meeting of the EU Foreign Affairs Council and meet with Belgian officials to discuss a wide ranging bilateral agenda that includes defense cooperation Afghan strategy and defeat of ISIS also in Brussels the secretary will meet with secretary general Stoltenberg who 's done so much for the NATO alliance presiding over a really expansive agenda these past few years also meet with other counterparts from NATO and the Georgian foreign minister to underscore the U.S. commitment to Georgian partnership with NATO in these and other meetings i think the essence of the messaging will be to reinforce president Trump 's central message of shared responsibility in Europe and the global agenda that we 're jointly managing with the EU NATO and European partners that includes DPRK Syria and issues related to Russia the secretary will then travel to Vienna on the 6th and through the 8th this is for the annual meeting of the OSCE and the emphasis there will be on the importance of members meeting the OSCE commitments in arms control and human rights the secretary will also reiterate in Vienna and i think all of our other stops the message of support for Ukraine Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity in Vienna there will also be a meeting with Austrian foreign minister Kurz to thank Austria for its contributions to peacekeeping missions in Afghanistan and Kosovo and continue to work with Austria on Western Balkans and issues in terrorism finally the secretary will travel to Paris on December 8th and meet with French counterparts as you all know we have a very special and deep cooperation with the French on a global agenda that encompasses issues in on Iran Syria Lebanon Libya DPRK and Sahel so it 's a very full agenda we 've got a lot of meetings both in the NATO format and the OSCE format but really both of those sets of organizational meetings provide a target rich environment for meeting with NATO and EU and other partner states more broadly so making the most of those opportunities to reinforce the messaging that was in the secretary 's speech earlier this week if you have n't had a chance to read that speech i would encourage you to do so i think it will preview for you some of the themes that you 'll see coming out of these meetings so again i 'm happy to be here and happy to take any questions moderator okay we 're ready to start taking questions operator thank you and ladies and gentlemen if you 'd like to ask a question please press then 1 on your telephone keypad you 'll hear a tone indicating you 've been placed in queue and you may remove yourself from the queue at any time by pressing the key our first question will come from Josh Lederman with the Associated Press please go ahead question hey thank you for doing the call considering that every major news organization in the U.S. is reporting that the president wants the secretary gone what reason would any of these leaders that he 's going to meet with have to believe that he has the speaks on behalf of the president or is has the authority to conduct foreign policy that 's likely to still be the foreign policy of the U.S. just a few weeks from now thanks senior STATE DEPARTMENT official thanks for that question Josh as the secretary has been clear really this is baseless speculation and a distraction i think the secretary is focused on doing his job we have a lot of work underway with allies in Europe this is not the first time there 's been speculation of this kind in the media and that has not impeded the secretary from working very effectively with close allies and partners and really the secretary over the last several months has built up close and continuing relationships with a number of world leaders but particularly in Europe and he continues to be committed to that really putting a lot of effort into developing these relationships that are we 've got a wide agenda on important security issues in particular so i think right now the secretary is just focused on doing the job at hand and we 'll let speculation take care of itself moderator okay we 're ready for our next question operator thank you that will be David Clark with AFP go ahead please question hi thanks for doing this as you mentioned in your opening remarks and also the secretary mentioned in his speech this week part of the relationships with Europe is about shared values but this week the Dutch and the British have both protested the president 's decision to endorse racist far right movements in the UK and his tweets in support of Britain First a fringe racist element which the British Government says does not reflect their values does this kind of prelude to the trip undermine the secretary 's attempts to form a bond senior STATE DEPARTMENT official thanks for that question David the secretary 's speech earlier this week i think he was crystal clear in articulating what America stands for as a force in the world and in our work with European allies and partners the transatlantic alliance is a very old alliance and set of relationships that we 've cultivated for many many years it 's based on a lot of things in the category of strategic interests but also in the category of values i think president Trump also articulated that very clearly in his Warsaw speech and frankly i would also say just the scope of the agenda that we 're managing with European allies and partners i think speaks for itself so we 're going into this trip focused on those critical areas including in the realm of values that 's why we 're up front and center at OSCE we see this as really an important set of messages to reinforce in the OSCE format again not only about the security commitment of OSCE states but about the human rights commitment so we 're still focused on an agenda that encompasses strategic interest and values secretary Tillerson feels very strongly about those values and i think you 'll see that continue to be the focus of U.S. foreign policy operator thank you and next we 'll go to Nick Wadhams with the Bloomberg News go ahead please question hi thank you can you tell us to what degree Syria will be a topic of discussion during this trip whether the secretary will be looking ahead to sort of post conflict reconstruction in Syria and then whether there would be a potential meeting with the Russian foreign minister at any time during this trip thank you senior STATE DEPARTMENT official Nick thank you for that question that 's a critical issue that the secretary feels very strongly about the secretary has been very active on Syria and in recent days as you 've seen the main focus really has been in pointing our Russian counterparts back towards the Geneva process and expanding the very successful de escalation zone that has really helped to save a lot of lives particularly a lot of civilian lives that continues to be the approach and Syria is really forefront in our dialogue with so many of our allies certainly our NATO allies even though the effort in Syria is not a NATO mission we work and coordinate very closely with NATO allies who are a part of the coalition as well as Arab states who are a part of the coalition i think particularly in our meetings with the French and British this will be a high focal point there is a meeting that 's been scheduled with foreign minister Lavrov we have a fairly robust set of discussions underway with the Russians on a lot of global issues dprk Ukraine and certainly Syria so the answer to your question would be yes Syria will very much be discussed and the U.S. approach continues to be to focus on moving the endgame in Syria towards an outcome that is in the interests of the Syrian people a unified Syria that has Assad in the rearview mirror so we 're working closely with a lot of partners on this and having very candid dialogues with the Russians as well operator thank you and just a reminder press 1 if you have a question and our next question will come from Carol Morello with The Washington Post please go ahead question hi thank you for doing this say when he is in Vienna at the OSCE do you expect him to make any progress on discussing a potential peacekeeping mission in Ukraine and can you give us any details about it and also you mentioned that at NATO he will be talking to the Europeans about stepping up their contributions for their own defense considering that he and the president have said have sent this message so many times before what more could he possible add is there anything new or is it just reiterating what has already been said probably dozens of times senior STATE DEPARTMENT official Carol thank you so much for that question starting with OSCE Ukraine will very much be on the agenda as you know OSCE plays a role in Ukraine particularly with the special monitoring mission the secretary really has a heart for the brave men and women who participate in the special monitoring mission and has raised this repeatedly their safety and security also the safety and security of the Ukrainian people in the east in the occupied territories who continue to be the target of military operations with the encouragement and participation of forces from the Russian Federation so the secretary feels very strongly about this portion of the agenda it there will be a focus on various dimensions of the Ukraine issue we continue to pursue negotiations with Russian counterparts led by our side obviously being led by Kurt Volker meeting a lot with Surkov in recent days as you know the Russians have put forward a proposal on peacekeeping which we 've explored we 're now in the latest the latest phase of that i think has indicated that the Russians have taken a step back to a certain extent but we 're still exploring the possible scope for this but i think the U.S. approach continues to emphasize that whatever comes out of this process needs to point towards a confirmation of the Minsk agreement it needs to be an outcome that would have a UN force encompassing the contested area and not just ratifying the gains that the Russians have made on the ground so that will be a focus we continue to work at that diplomacy and look for a way to exit the violence i think that 's in the interest of the Ukrainians and of the Russians as well in terms of the burden sharing agenda in NATO as you know this has been a longstanding message now for not just this administration but for previous American presidents and secretaries of defense and state the secretary will continue to make the point that NATO is safer and stronger when all allies are sharing are shouldering their fair share of the defense burden but i think you 'll also see that the United States approach is to highlight the great strides that have been made by allies we 've seen a real uptick in the last several months in increased spending and promises of increased spending so i think the burden sharing agenda is partly about whether allies are spending more on defense but it 's also about what allies are doing and we 've been very encouraged to see European allies doing more in the Baltic under the umbrella of EFP the CT missions and activities in Syria have been a real encouragement and we really want to build on that i do n't think that 's a conversation that 's ever fully complete but i think part of American leadership is continuing to put this on the agenda but also in the leadup to the NATO summit steering allies towards the kind of actions they can take to give substance to their increased verbal commitments at Warsaw and as i 've said that 's not only financial but political will operator thank you and one more reminder please press 1 now if you have a question and we 'll go to Dmitry Zlodorev with RIA go ahead please question thank you i think you answered my question already thank you operator all right thank you then we 'll go next to David Clark with AFP please go ahead question no again Carol asked my question for me so i 'm fine thanks operator all right thank you then we will move on to Nick Wadhams with the Bloomberg News go ahead please question sorry could you just say where the Lavrov meeting will take place and what day that is senior STATE DEPARTMENT official let 's see here we have the Lavrov meeting is taking place in Vienna on the sidelines of the OSCE ministerial and let me check on the date my understanding is it 's tentatively scheduled for the 7th but it 's as you know these meetings the scheduling of these meetings unfolds as the trip planning is underway what i have right now is on the sidelines of the OSCE ministerial on the 7th moderator okay well i think that Senior State Department official has we 've run out of time for today 's call but we definitely appreciate you calling in and hope you have a great day thanks very much

referring to question no no it has n't senior STATE DEPARTMENT official oh so you want me to comment on it laughter question no i want to know how important it is it 's a point obviously now the president 's going to talk about this in this JCPOA address senior STATE DEPARTMENT official yeah question so clearly this is something that you 're going to show and then you 're going to say to critics look we 're not abandoning diplomacy we 're not doing any of this we 're working with the North Koreans they 've shown goodwill so i want to know is that really something that you 're going to be pushing on that this is a sign that America and the Trump administration is not opposed to negotiating with allies i mean with adversaries based on senior state department official i think our diplomacy in North Korea speaks for itself and answers the question that you 're asking if you look at the history of negotiations between the U.S. and North Korea it 's been a bottom up approach to a lot of work at kind of the sub presidential level to try to get to an outcome that can bring the leaders together this president is taking the rather bold step of reversing that formula after setting very powerful setting a very powerful pressure campaign to bring the North Koreans to the negotiating table but he 's now showing what we 've said all along we are committed to a diplomatic solution to the nuclear crisis question when you say bold steps what are you looking for you 're looking for a release of three American three Korean American prisoners on that what kind of bold steps do you want senior STATE DEPARTMENT official i think i 'll just leave it as i mentioned bold steps in contrast to the past decades of incremental gradual long term eventual disarmament that formula has failed to secure the peace question what are you inaudible moderator the secretary can speak you can ask the secretary about that on the record senior STATE DEPARTMENT official i 'm not going to comment on that i 'll leave that to the secretary question okay what kind of details are you looking for because since that speech in January the secretary has been here and spoken with the leader himself what is what are you looking for now that 's different than what he heard in March when he was here senior STATE DEPARTMENT official well i think the purpose of this meeting is to set the table for a possible meeting between their heads of government and i would n't speculate beyond that question how is this different than what he did in March senior STATE DEPARTMENT official well because he 's now the secretary of State and that 's an entirely different role and so i think this gives him an opportunity to have an expanded discussion question so you expect that the inaudible senior STATE DEPARTMENT official the time and the place for the meeting has not been set moderator well you can ask the secretary that about some of the specifics of it question okay that 's directly opposite of what the president said senior STATE DEPARTMENT official i do n't think it 's the it 's not the direct opposite of it he 's saying that that 's the opposite of what the president has said i said that the timing and the place of the meeting has not been set question he said the date and place have been set moderator what Matt question yeah Trump said president question the president said that the date and the place had been set moderator we 'll double check on that okay but you can ask you can ask the secretary i know we 're not going to be announcing anything at this time question who 's he going to be meeting with you 're saying North Korean Government do you what officials will he be meeting with Kim Jong un himself senior STATE DEPARTMENT official i ca n't hear you question who will who specifically will he be meeting with how high up will he be meeting with Kim Jong un senior STATE DEPARTMENT official do n't have any comment on that question you just said the government senior STATE DEPARTMENT official yeah i do n't have that 's the government i do n't have any comment on that yet question does that mean you 're going in without knowing who you 're going to be talking to senior STATE DEPARTMENT official i 'm not going to get into the preparations for this the trip kind of speaks for itself question can i ask a senior state department official we 'll have the full readout when it 's over question when you talk about bold moves the one bold move that we 've got here is the president agreeing to meet with Kim is senior state department official that is a bold move question do you consider Kim 's agreeing to meet with the president also a bold move on his part what other beyond that boldness what else are you looking for i mean moderator Matt i think the secretary could best answer that one senior STATE DEPARTMENT official he can answer it moderator since he 's been with him face to face senior STATE DEPARTMENT official he can answer this question question no no no but i mean citing the bold movement what about what they 're doing i mean someone argued that when they blew off the Yongbyon cooling tower that it was a publicity stunt but that was a bold move it was something senior state department official that was not a bold move question well it was something that senior state department official that was theatrical meant for wide mass consumption and to mislead people on the threat of a nuclear program we are not going to fall for theatrical theatrical pronouncements on the end of their nuclear program that is not convincing evidence of dismantling their nuclear program it was n't then and it will not be now question no it you 're absolutely right it was n't but it was seen as something you think that the that that administration fell for fell for a theatrical trick senior STATE DEPARTMENT official the efforts of the past however well intentioned have not addressed the North Korean threat to our security interests question right but so you 're saying moderator all right Senior State Department official 's going to have to go question that the Bush administration got i 'm going to next time i talk to Chris Hill i 'm going to question any deliverables senior STATE DEPARTMENT official feel free feel free question can you give us any deliverables moderator you can ask you can ask the secretary that he 'll be back in a few minutes senior STATE DEPARTMENT official yeah question all right
"June 5, 2018",press statement heather Nauert Department spokesperson Washington dc June 5 2018 The United States calls on the government of Ukraine to implement deep comprehensive and timely reforms that reflect the demands the people of Ukraine made during the Revolution of Dignity an end to systemic corruption faster economic growth and a European future for all Ukrainians the establishment of a genuinely independent anti corruption court is the most important immediate step the government can take to meet those demands and roll back corruption that continues to threaten Ukraine 's national security prosperity and democratic development The United States fully supports the International Monetary Fund imf which will determine whether a new law establishing the court is consistent with Ukraine 's commitments under its IMF program we agree with the imf that any legislation establishing an anti corruption court must include a central role for a council of international experts to ensure the selection of qualified judges The United States wants to be clear that legislation establishing the court must satisfy the IMF which provides essential financial support to the Ukrainian government we therefore encourage the Ukrainian government to discuss relevant legislative proposals directly with the IMF and to pass a bill that meets imf requirements the anti corruption court has important work to do on behalf of the people of Ukraine
"March 18, 2020",Yesterday the U.S. Department of State sanctioned nine entities and three individuals who have engaged in activity that could enable the Iranian regime 's violent behavior the actions of these individuals and entities provide revenue to the regime that it may use to fund terror and other destabilizing activities such as the recent rocket attacks on Iraqi and coalition forces located at Camp Taji in Iraq our sanctions will deprive the regime of critical income from its petrochemical industry and further Iran 's economic and diplomatic isolation The United States will continue to fully enforce our sanctions
"April 29, 2020","question they 're telling us to mind our own business that 's what China is telling us let 's bring in Mike Pompeo secretary of State good morning to you secretary pompeo Ainsley it 's great to be with you this morning question can you believe that they 're telling us to mind our own business that we 're lying through our teeth meanwhile we have almost 60,000 people dead so many people out of work and they 're telling us to mind our own business how are we going to how are we going to fire back what are we going to do to hold them accountable secretary pompeo so Ainsley this very much is our own business i was talking with some friends back in Kansas i 'm sure Steve knows some of them they 've been impacted by this in ways that are going to fundamentally change their lives over the course of the next several months they 're trying to figure their way out of this what the Chinese Communist Party did here in not preventing the spread of this around the world they are responsible for America needs to hold them accountable i 've been heartened to see Australia other countries joining this demanding an investigation because while we know this started in Wuhan China we do n't yet know from where it started and in spite of our best efforts to get experts on the ground they continue to try and hide and obfuscate that 's wrong it continues to pose a threat to the world and we all need to get to the bottom of what actually happened here not only for the current instant but to make sure something like this does n't happen again there are still many labs operating inside of China today and the world needs to know that we 're not going to see a repeat of this in the days and weeks and months ahead question well if it did come from the wet markets it will come again because they are back i 've seen the video you know more than i 'll ever know they are back so they have n't learned their lesson either that or it came from the Wuhan laboratory and they 're lying again here 's what China said when the criticism starts coming out of America where we are to them we advise American politicians to reflect on their own problems and try their best to control the epidemic as soon as possible instead of continuing to play tricks to deflect blame can you read between the lines for us secretary pompeo yeah they know that this happened in their country this is classic communist disinformation this is what communists do the Chinese people were harmed by this too The Chinese Communist Party we know there were journalists that were kicked out we know that there were doctors that tried to tell this story and instead they were pushed aside covered up taken out of the news those are the kind of things that communist institutions do we all know them from the Soviet days we know the kinds of things that communist parties do to try and manage information inside of their own country and around the world and so we see these efforts i saw a foreign ministry official this morning on tv trying to change this narrative we know that this virus started in Wuhan China we now have the chinese communist party now has a responsibility to tell the world how this pandemic got out of China and all across the world causing such global economic devastation question yeah i mean if we would have known earlier things could be a lot different there 's a story in the New York Post that apparently dr. Fauci 's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases shelled out a total of $ 7.4 million to the Wuhan Institute of Virology lab which has become the center of theories about the origin of COVID and also mr. secretary i understand that apparently Democratic senators have written a letter to you they want to see some cables any or all cables that the State Department might have regarding this as well what can you tell us about what 's going on behind the scenes at that federal level secretary pompeo so i ca n't i do n't know the details of the NIH grants i do know a bit about the cables we 'll do our best to respond to those two senators look the United States for a long time and continuing today tries to help countries around the world who are conducting research on highly contagious pathogens we do this not only in China but we try to bring our expertise from our National Institutes of Health from our CDC to precisely prevent something like this that 's the reason that we spend American taxpayer dollars is to protect American people from labs that are n't up to standard i can tell you there are were real concerns about the labs inside of China and i have to say i 'm still concerned that the Chinese Communist Party is not telling us about all of what 's taking place in all of the labs in fact each of the labs all across China today question yeah pretty scary what 's happening in North Korea what 's the latest there any sightings of Kim Jong un secretary pompeo Ainsley not much to add to what the president said yesterday we have n't seen him we do n't have any information to report today we 're watching it closely keeping track of what 's going on not only around chairman Kim himself but more broadly inside of North Korea they also have the risk of COVID there and there is a real risk that there will be a famine a food shortage inside of North Korea too we 're watching each of those things closely as they have a real impact on our mission set which is to ultimately denuclearize North Korea question and your administration knows better than any other administration in the past or present what these people are like face to face because you know your counterparts better because you 've had all these meetings since then but let 's move over to Iran Iran 's flat on its back right economically with the coronavirus the humiliation of having Soleimani killed and then shooting down a passenger jet but yet you say they 're still up to their unsavory acts they shot a satellite into sky they say is so terrible it 's just a basically a it 's a traveling webcam up there so the embarrassment of that but you say they 're still up to some up to no good in what way secretary pompeo they 're trying to put disinformation out as well Brian they 're telling the world that they 're broke and they need relief from American sanctions they need humanitarian assistance but we 've offered humanitarian assistance and the ayatollah and the kleptocrats the theocrats that lead the Iranian regime today are still out spending money on things that do n't benefit the Iranian people things like the military missile launch in violation of UN Security Council resolution 2231 and they 're continuing to fund Lebanese Hizballah and the Iraqi Shia all the things that take money out of the mouths of the people inside of Iran so no one should be fooled about this regime if they truly cared about their people they 'd behave in a way that is fundamentally different it 's what we 've been trying to get them to do for our three years in office and i 'm convinced we 're on the right path to deny them their resources the regime the resources to threaten America that 's been president Trump 's goal to deny them a nuclear weapon we 're determined to do that question all right mr. secretary the United States has really mobilized in producing masks and ventilators as well as figuring out the testing situation the president has made it very clear that he 's talked to other countries about how we did it but at the same time other countries reached out to the United States and said hey if you 've got some spare ventilators we can use them over here obviously some countries are downplaying the impact of COVID in their nations but who is reaching out for help to the United States secretary pompeo Steve a lot of countries are asking us for assistance and a lot of countries have received assistance we 've of course done the right thing we 've made sure we had the resources for our own people but as the American greatness as American power and American commercial prosperity continues to grow we 're building out we 're getting not only ventilators but all of the equipment that the world will need The United States will be an enormous force for good in countries in South America in countries in Africa all across the world helping them solve this problem for themselves which in turn if we get it right we can reduce the risk of COVID in their countries will reduce the risk that it comes back to our country either this fall or again next year question yeah which countries that experienced this before our country did which ones are you watching to see how they reopen their businesses and they get back to work secretary pompeo we 're watching a number of countries we 're watching how Singapore handles it although they 've had a resurgence in cases in their country as well South Korea too had some success at the front end and now they 're trying to maintain that we 're watching each of them to see how not only they 're doing it inside of their own country but these are countries that often buy products from American companies we want to make sure that they get their markets back open and that American products and American jobs return here in our country as well question for the longest time the State Department would dance on the edges of what should we be tight with China not tight with China they make things so cheap and they make things also that are cheap and a lot of times they break and ineffective but for the first time in all of our lifetime the world has been poisoned by this country and there 's only one way to point is to China as secretary of State do you have a unique opportunity to unite the world and open up their eyes to the type of regime this is and is there a plan in place with the nine months or four and a half years you have left to neutralize this superpower secretary pompeo Brian you 've hit it square on the head i think president Trump said it clearly himself as well the threat the risk the danger and now the harm that the Chinese Communist Party has imposed not only on the United States but all around the world we not only have an opportunity we have an obligation to get this right to unite the freedom loving nations likeminded countries around the world to make sure that it is not a communist regime that controls our infrastructure we 've talked about this with you all with Huawei our telecommunications infrastructure we know what this needs to look like and the United States has an obligation to get this right we 'll do this to make sure that we keep the American people safe and get our economy back on its feet and continue to make America the most prosperous wonderful great nation in the history of civilization question mr. secretary i think before this covid crisis struck i think the conventional wisdom was that the president was going to be able to broker a trade deal with China maybe just five minutes before the election or whatever it would just be one of those things that he would be able to say look i was able to do a deal with China right now the politics are very complicated and given the fact that China has done what they have done not being forthcoming with this epidemic it probably does n't look too good for a deal does it secretary pompeo so Steve look we 've got this is the conundrum we 've got the phase one trade deal China continues to make promises and says they 'll live up to it i hope that they do we have every expectation today that they will it 's certainly what they had agreed to but we 've watched China now break repeated promises they say they 're transparent they say they want to be open they say they want to join the community of nations and then we watched them in this crisis behave in ways that are just the opposite of that i hope we can find a way to have commercial relationships with them where it makes sense for America and American businesses but president Trump has from the beginning said we need fair and reciprocal trade with China and that 's what he 's going to continue to demand question mr. secretary thanks for joining us this morning secretary pompeo Ainsley thank you ma'am question you 're welcome"
"December 11, 2018",press statement Michael R. Pompeo secretary of State Washington dc December 11 2018 on behalf of the government of the United States of America i congratulate the government and people of Burkina faso as you celebrate your national day on December 11 The United States supports Burkina Faso 's efforts to build stronger democratic institutions promote economic reform confront terrorist threats and improve health to ensure prosperity for all burkinabe we applaud your cooperation with international and multilateral partners in regional peacekeeping efforts including your role in the g5 Sahel best wishes on your 58th anniversary The United States looks forward to strengthening our partnership with Burkina Faso
"April 13, 2019",question thank you secretary Pompeo for another time another opportunity to talk to you secretary pompeo it 's great to be with you again question thank you let 's begin with one of the hottest topics Venezuela this is one of the topics you have been talking about for quite a long time already and i would like to know how you can explain to the Venezuelan people who is the real president we take into consideration that some Venezuelans still pay taxes to the government of Nicolas Maduro if a government a foreign government needs to help their own citizens living in Venezuela they need to get in contact with Maduro 's officers how can we explain that to the Venezuelan people secretary pompeo that 's a great and important question the Venezuelan people have spoken the sham election that gave Maduro the pretend authority that he has the world has recognized there are now 54 countries in addition to the people of Venezuela who recognize that Maduro is not a legitimate leader he still has control of elements of power to be sure but the people have spoken we know what they want Maduro and his henchmen have destroyed this nation the Venezuelan people can see that very plainly it 's why they did n't want him back they gave power to the National Assembly now Juan Guaido in a way that will ultimately deliver true democracy and prosperity back to Venezuela you know the history this is a rich nation a wealthy nation a nation of people who are industrious and are prepared to work very very hard what they need is a leader who is prepared to help them not be corrupt not turn over power to the Cubans and demand interventions to save them by the Russians the new leadership will do that and the United States stands ready to support not only the Venezuelan people but all of the countries in this region we 're sitting here today in Paraguay the countries of this region who recognize the same question what about if Maduro continues to hold the military power and to hold the city does the U.S. have a new strategy to go does Maduro have a deadline for example for the U.S. Government secretary pompeo so the strategy is not just an American strategy it 's the Venezuelan people 's strategy the opposition groups banded together made clear that it was unacceptable what Maduro 's regime did they gave Juan Guaido the authority through the National Assembly to lead their nation forward this wo n't be an American solution to this problem it 'll be the solution that the Venezuelan people choose i remark sometimes people think Maduro is winning and yet he 's handed over all of his power to the Cubans to the Russians this is weakness from Maduro and so this weakness will ultimately lead to his departure and democracy and prosperity will be restored in Venezuela i am very confident of that question and i know you already answered this question many times but i have to ask are all options on the table still secretary pompeo of course they remain on the table we keep all options on the table because it 's very important in that we do n't know how things will proceed the Venezuelan people are entitled to the democracy that they have demanded and we want to make sure that the resources of the United States of America are n't foreclosed from being used if that turns out to be the right thing to do question now as you mentioned Maduro has the support of Russia and China does that turn a decision against the government of Maduro more complex to take could this rise tensions between Washington and the Kremlin secretary pompeo i always remark i 'll hear some of the Maduro people talk about intervention in Venezuela the Russians will say the Americans should n't intervene in Venezuela i mean it 's almost funny to say right they have intervened in the most fundamental ways the Cubans own the security apparatus i would think if you were a Venezuelan military leader you 'd be embarrassed by that right the people the people of Venezuela want their own security they want their own democracy they want Venezuelans to lead their nation not people from a small island not people from Russia they want their country to be led by their own people and that 's what that 's what Brazil and Colombia the Lima Group the OAS here in Paraguay that 's what all the leaders of the region are demanding and it 's what the United States stands ready to support question is there any line of communication between U.S. officials and Venezuelan militaries secretary pompeo i do n't think there 's any mistake about what America 's position is with respect to the Venezuelan military we 've made clear publicly that they ought not to continue to support Maduro that this regime is over it 's done its day is finished and that a new page needs to be turned and that those who continue to support Maduro will face their own consequences and those who make a different decision those military leaders that make the decision to defend the Venezuelan people will find happier days question and does the U.S. support or has given any advice to the Guaido government about giving amnesty to any Venezuelan military who turns their back on Venezuelan government secretary pompeo sure we 're talked with Juan Guaido about what a first day would look like right Maduro will leave and we want to make sure that that next day that the world stands ready to support Venezuela that will involve making decisions about how to address the transgressions of senior military leaders those that inflicted violence those who did harm to Venezuelans well they 'll be held accountable those who made a different decision a better decision a decision on behalf of the democratic institutions of Venezuela will be treated very differently question with many countries in Latin America turning to the right and with the economical crisis in Venezuela at its worst do you think the Iranian Government still have some presence in Latin America and if it does is it still a threat for the U.S. national security secretary pompeo so the question is does the do the Iranians yes there 's no doubt Iranian money remains in South America being used for malign purposes supporting Hizballah supporting transnational criminal organizations supporting efforts at terrorism throughout the region The United States is working with our partners in this area to take down those networks to take down that risk irgc you saw the other day there was an air flight straight straight from Tehran to Caracas this is Iran intervening in South America that 's not in the best interest of the South American people and the United States stands ready we see Iran for what it is the world 's largest state sponsor of terror that 's a global threat and we 're prepared to push back against it not only in the Middle East but in South America and wherever we find that threat present question moving forward secretary Pompeo yesterday you mentioned in a speech from Santiago in Santiago and you used Chile as an example as a model for economical growth but Chile also have many trades with China $ 43 billion if i 'm not mistaken and the U.S. comes as a second partner can any country from Latin America have economical and diplomatic relationship with China while at the same time they do with the United States secretary pompeo well of course what we have said about China is very clear The United States has big economic relationships with China we want China to thrive and prosper here 's what we do n't want especially in South America we do n't want China to show up with bags full of money and bribe officials we do n't want China to show up and put Huawei or Chinese technology into the infrastructure of these countries so that the citizens the citizens of Chile or the citizens of Paraguay have their information their private information stolen by the Chinese Government we do n't want corrupt activity China should compete we have democracies here in South America now this is a glorious thing where there 's free markets and capitalism and opportunity that value set of transparency of the rule of law that 's the one the South American people are demanding it is not what China brings if China shows up to compete on a commercial basis that seems perfectly reasonable when they show up with malign intent to give money with strings attached which will destroy the sovereignty of a South American nation that 's not good for the people in that country and the United States is prepared to help those countries recognize that threat and to offer alternatives to it question changing the topic a little bit the U.S. cut the funds for three countries in Central America Honduras Guatemala and El Salvador is this a final decision or can they make things better and gain the confidence of the U.S. Government and also the money secretary pompeo yeah of course they can The United States is the most generous nation when it comes to both humanitarian and foreign assistance of any country in the world the Trump administration has maintained that what we want to make sure is where we provide those resources those dollars from the American taxpayer that they are effective that we get outcomes not only what we want but that those countries want as well so president Trump 's decision we saw that those countries were n't doing what needed to be done to prevent this enormous migration challenge this crisis that the United States has at its southern border as those countries work to develop systems to prevent their citizens from taking this incredibly dangerous journey from Guatemala from Honduras or from El Salvador through Mexico into the United States when those countries begin to take actions that stop that we 'll reconsider that decision question and my last question secretary This week Nicaragua will remember a year since the political and social crisis began More than 350 people died in this crisis the negotiations are very slow right now and their oppression continues with people who has demonstrated publicly is the United States taking new steps against the government of the president in Nicaragua secretary pompeo that 's a great question here i am in Paraguay i was in Chile i 'll be in Peru i 'll be in Colombia before i head back to the United States you watch most of the countries in South and Central America turning in the direction of freedom in the direction of liberty in the direction of democracy and yet you have Venezuela and Nicaragua stuck in history stuck with dictatorships stuck with bad leadership kleptocrats stealing from their own people our efforts in Nicaragua are very similar to those in Venezuela we want the Nicaraguan people to have all the great things that they are entitled to have and that they so desperately want and mr. Ortega and his wife both need to change their ways in order to give Nicaragua that very opportunity question secretary Pompeo thank you very much for your time with Voice of America 's Spanish Service secretary pompeo thank you very much thank you sir it 's great to see you again question thank you

to the State Department on this important occasion i was at the White House last week for the Abraham Accords a great step forward towards peace in the Middle East and today i 'm proud to announce how the Trump administration is taking even more action to further that same goal and protect the American people over the weekend the U.S. effort to restore virtually all previously terminated UN sanctions on the Islamic Republic of Iran including the arms embargo pursuant to UN Security Council resolution 2231 the Trump administration has always been honest about the what the Iranian regime really is radical revolutionary and the world 's leading state sponsor of terrorism and anti semitism president Trump understood that the JCPOA was a abject failure it did n't bring Iran into the community of nations or block Tehran 's path to a nuclear weapon instead it was an exercise in appeasement it gifted the regime billions and paved the way for Iran to become the arms dealer of choice for terrorist groups and dictators all across the world in just five short years just imagine what Iran would do if it were able to freely purchase more advanced weapons we have no intention of letting that happen the president 's executive order announced today gives us a new and powerful tool to enforce the UN arms embargo and hold those who seek to evade UN sanctions accountable Today i will take the first action under this new executive order by sanctioning the Iranian Ministry of Defense and Armed Forces Logistics and Iran 's Defense Industries Organization and its director we 're also sanctioning the previous president of Venezuela Nicolas Maduro for nearly two years corrupt officials in Tehran have worked with the illegitimate regime in Venezuela to flout the UN arms embargo our actions today are a warning that should be heard worldwide no matter who you are if you violate the UN arms embargo on Iran you risk sanctions i 'm also announcing sanctions on Hamid Reza Ghadirian and Ahmad shiva'i under an existing U.S. authority targeting proliferators of weapons of mass destruction these individuals are central to Iran 's uranium enrichment operations when we launched the maximum pressure campaign back in 2018 under president Trump 's leadership the critics said it would n't work they were wrong our sanctions have saved countless Muslim Jewish and Christian lives by denying Tehran access to more than $ 70 billion that could have otherwise gone to terror we 've done this all while keeping a channel open for humanitarian trade and assistance as we are demonstrating today we 'll keep it up until the Iranian regime comes to the table and accepts a real deal for changing its behavior the American people should know that we will always put their safety first i 'll now turn the podium over to secretary Mnuchin Steven secretary mnuchin thank you secretary Pompeo it 's a pleasure to be here with you at the State Department the administration will not allow Iran to endanger the rest of the world with a fresh supply of ballistic missiles and conventional arms Today the Treasury Department is designating entities that support Iran 's nuclear and ballistic missile programs and senior officials overseeing Iran 's nuclear power ballistic missile development a number of our targets today are affiliated with the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran which has operational and regulatory control over the nuclear program and bears responsibility for nuclear research and development Three of the deputy directors have been sanctioned today as well as three entities subordinate to AEOI that are active components of Iran 's civil nuclear program Treasury also designated several key producers and suppliers of military grade dual use goods for Iran 's ballistic missile programs Mammut Industries and Mammut Diesel along with several shareholders and senior officials of these companies are among those designated today i also want to highlight designations of a particular component of Shahid Hemmat Industrial Group Iran 's primary developer of liquid propelled missiles in particular Shahid Haj Ali Movahed Research Center is responsible for the integration final assembly testing of liquid propellant ballistic missiles and space launch vehicles furthermore any financial institutions that knowingly facilitate a significant transaction for these individuals or entities could be subject to U.S. sanctions this administration will use every tool at our disposal to stop Iran 's nuclear ballistic missile and conventional weapons pursuits which it uses directly to threaten and terrorize the rest of the world and secretary Pompeo i 'm going to apologize for having to leave but thank you for including me secretary pompeo thank you Steven secretary ESPER good morning everyone and thank you Last week the president took an historic step toward a peaceful and prosperous Middle East with the signing of the Abraham Accords Today the United States is taking another important step to both protect the American people and deter Iranian aggression against our troops our interests and our allies and partners over the past two years Tehran has carried out attacks on international shipping regional infrastructure and on U.S. and partner nation forces this included missile strikes by Iranian backed proxy militias against U.S. bases and personnel in Iraq moreover Iran has violated UN Security Council resolutions for years by proliferating advanced conventional weapons to non state actors such as Hizballah and the Houthis who use them to threaten civilian population centers this is why the Department of Defense has taken decisive action to safeguard our brave men and women in uniform restore deterrence and safeguard international rules and norms when it comes to issues such as freedom of commerce and navigation we stand ready to respond to future Iranian aggression and we remain committed to doing our part in the administration 's maximum pressure campaign Today 's executive order will further disrupt Iranian efforts to import and proliferate conventional weapons helping protect U.S. forces our allies and partners and civilian populations until Iran complies with international norms we encourage Tehran to cease its malign activities throughout the region and to act like a normal country but we are also prepared to respond to Iranian aggression our commanders have the authorities and resources they need to protect their troops and to prepare for any contingencies and we continue to stand shoulder to shoulder with our allies and partners to counter Iran 's destabilizing behavior in doing so we will protect our people and our interests and maintain the security of likeminded nations across the region thank you secretary ROSS good morning i 'm grateful for the president 's commitment to ending Iran 's nuclear ballistic missile and conventional weapons undertakings that threaten and terrorize the rest of the world Today U.S. Department of Commerce is adding five Iranian scientists to the entity list for enabling or assisting Iran 's nuclear development program the individuals added to the list are Ahmad Nozad Gholik Behnam Pouremadi Hamid Sepehrian mojtaba Farhadi Ganjeh Sayyed Javad Ahmadi pouremadi inaudible and Ganjeh are associated with Iran 's JHL laboratory the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran involved in nuclear activities and designated by the United States Security Council by the UN Security Council in resolution 1803 on Iran 's nuclear program pouremadi has pursued sensitive equipment and materials for AEOI using deceptive practices and obfuscation Ganjeh has worked with overseas Iranian procurement agents to acquire sensitive nuclear related items including western goods he also traveled overseas for training and sought information in support of AEOI technical questions Gholik is associated with an AEOI subsidiary that implements various projects in the nuclear field he has worked with overseas Iranian agents to procure sensitive items including those that can be used in spent nuclear fuel reprocessing Ahmadi is an AEOI employee who has traveled overseas for nuclear related meetings as listed entities these persons are subject to additional licensing requirements for exports for re exports and in country transfers per our export administration regulations these five individuals played a critical role in Iran 's nuclear weapons development program and continue to work for the Iranian regime Iran must comply with its nuclear safeguard obligations and immediately cooperate with the international community The Department of Commerce stands beside president Trump in his commitment to preventing Iran from ever acquiring a nuclear weapon under president Trump 's leadership i 'm proud to join Secretaries Pompeo and Mnuchin and National Security adviser O'Brien and ambassador Craft in holding Iran accountable and deterring its progress toward obtaining a nuclear weapon thank you ambassador craft good morning the actions we 're announcing today and our work in the Security Council over the last three months have been driven by a single purpose the pursuit of peace what makes America unique is that we stand up for what is right as we have in the past we will stand alone to protect peace and security at all times we do n't need a cheering section to validate our moral compass we do not find comfort based solely on numbers particularly when the majority has found themselves in an uncomfortable position of underwriting terrorism chaos and conflict we refuse to be members of that club The United States is a force for good in the world we led the creation of the multilateral system we know today and we remain its largest funder but as i have said repeatedly when it fails we will not False hopes on part of the Security Council members that the JCPOA might contain Iran 's nuclear ambitions do not excuse members from their obligations to reimpose sanctions pursuant to the process outlined in Resolution 2231 it is now our expectation that all UN member states will fulfill their legal obligation and reimpose sanctions on Iran as we have demonstrated today the United States will do everything necessary to ensure that the Islamic Republic of Iran the world 's leading state sponsor of terrorism can not inflict even greater harm on the world with more deadly weapons we are doing this for peace we are doing this for the safety of the American people the people of the Middle East the people of Europe and the people of the world thank you mr o'brien good morning thank you secretary Pompeo secretary Esper secretary Ross ambassador Craft Today the president is taking decisive action to restrict Iran 's access to nuclear technology ballistic missile technology and conventional weapons The UN Security Council has sadly failed in its mission to promote international peace and security by not extending the conventional arms embargo on Iran unlike the UN the United States will not allow Iran to further endanger the Middle East or the world as an importer and exporter of ballistic missiles and other advanced conventional weapon systems it will certainly seek to become a major arms dealer when the UN embargo lapses accordingly the president signed just moments ago in the Oval Office an executive order this morning which will result in severe economic sanctions for those nations corporations and individuals who contribute to the supply the sale or the transfer of conventional arms to the Islamic Republic of Iran president Trump 's order will prevent the export of conventional arms to rogue regimes by Iran the order will also ban the export of weapons by arms producing nations to Iran where Iran would in turn provide them to terrorists and to rogue regimes simply put the United States can not stand idly by while Iran destabilizes the region and beyond through the purchase and sale of advanced conventional weapons the Trump administration is also imposing new sanctions and export control measures on 27 entities and individuals connected to Iran 's nuclear weapons program finally the United States has restored previously suspended UN sanctions on Iran when the United States entered into the failed Iran nuclear deal the Obama administration told the American people that the United States would always have the right to restore UN sanctions on Iran even without the approval of other nations that provision was key to obtaining the United States approval for the JCPOA president Trump is now exercising our rights to protect America and our allies the Iranian regime has repeatedly lied about its nuclear weapons program its archive and denied access to international inspectors Today 's actions send a clear message to the Iranian regime that such conduct will not be tolerated The United States is also sending an unmistakable message to the international community those who appease and enable Iran that they must at long last turn away from Iran 's malign activities rather than waste resources chasing after a nuclear bomb or regional hegemony the Iranian regime should provide the Iranian people with what they want and with what they deserve a thriving and prosperous Iran after decades of division and conflicts a new dawn has arisen in the Middle East The Abraham Accords signed at the White House last week represent the most a significant step toward peace in the Middle East in over 25 years Iran should use this moment in history they should forswear terror hegemony and the pursuit of nuclear weapons and put away old grievances Iran should join its neighbors who are embracing a better future based on progress shared interest and shared goals the president has made it clear that if Iran is willing to choose the path of peace America will walk beside it thank you very much ms ortagus okay we have time for a few questions Rich Edson get the mic behind you Rich question oh thank you very much mr. secretary secretary Pompeo and this is also for anybody else who may want to answer Reuters is reporting that a U.S. official is warning that Iran could have enough fissile material for a nuclear weapon by the end of the year do you think that is possible and would that be different had the United States remained in the JCPOA secretary pompeo so i do n't want to comment on intelligence matters but one of the reasons that the JCPOA was such an enormous failure is it created a simple pathway for Iran very quickly to generate the fissile material that it needed for a nuclear weapon right in a matter of months they could turn it on and get after it this was one of the central failures of that agreement your question where would we be had we not withdrawn is Iran would have significantly more wealth the regime would have even more money to build more centrifuges to build more capabilities the build more air defense systems to prevent us from having the capacity to prevent them from getting a nuclear weapon all of the elements of the terror state would be enhanced had we not done what president Trump directed back in May of 2018 the efforts today are to continue to reduce that risk that they will have the wealth and resources to foment terror throughout the region and indeed throughout the world anyone else Robert anybody mr o'brien i 'll just mention when this deal was signed Iran was at the breaking point and instead of keeping sanctions on and getting a great deal the United States and a number of other countries took the pressure off Iran and they gave Iran $ 150 billion in sanctions relief they also gave Iran another $ 1.8 billion in settlement for cases 400 million in swiss francs so that was in cash the idea was that if this money was given to Iran that Iran would use it for its middle class would make Iran a prosperous state a regular stakeholder in the world instead what Iran did is they used that for terrorist proxy wars throughout the Middle East what 's happened with the sanctions that have been reimposed by president Trump and his administration is that Iran again has been squeezed and we 're seeing that reflected in Hizballah 's restricted funds we 've seen it in the Houthis restricted funds we 've seen it in some breathing space in Iraq so this these sanctions will further enhance peace in the region by denying funds to the Iranians who use those money use that those funds a to build centrifuges to spin centrifuges and to support their aims in the region and globally what we want is a great deal with Iran and what the president has said is if Iran is willing to forswear regional terrorism and proxy wars and is willing to end its pursuit of a nuclear bomb Iran could be a tremendously prosperous state it has tremendous oil reserves it could be just a beacon in the Middle East and the Iranian people most importantly could enjoy prosperity and peace unfortunately the regime has n't chosen that route we 're hoping that with these renewed sanctions that will be some inducement for Iran to change its behavior thank you ms ortagus Stars and Stripes Caitlin Kenney it 's right up here question Off mike ms ortagus Caitlin there 's a mic right behind you question inaudible thank you in reference to secretary Esper 's comments about protecting the forces are military now in the region being put on a higher state of alert what are some of the ways that you 're doing to protect the troops that are there secretary ESPER well our military forces in the Middle East of course maintain a high state of alert and we are constantly looking at adjustments i 've had the chance over the last 24 hours to talk to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and he has spoken with our commanders as well and we continue to maintain all of our operational readiness we need we are in close contact with our partners in the intelligence agencies and of course with our regional partners and allies so again we feel very confident with regard to our readiness and preparedness to deal with anything that might happen in the region again the important thing is that Iran complies with international rules and norms and the expectations we have set forth for them and become a normal country thank you ms ortagus can merey DPA right here question thank you thanks a lot secretary Pompeo the E3 countries are not engaging with the U.S. claim that it triggered the snapback they even called it incapable of having any legal effect what measures specifically is the Trump administration planning to bring Germany and the other countries in line secretary pompeo so two things First the country that 's isolated today is not the United States but rather Iran by these actions we have made very clear that every member state in the United Nations has a responsibility to enforce these sanctions that certainly includes the United Kingdom France and Germany we will have every expectation that those nations enforce these sanctions Second if you are serious about peace in the Middle East if you 're serious about denying the main threat in the Middle East i think Europeans understand the risk to their countries and where it emanates from the place is the Islamic Republic of Iran so i 'm very confident that the people of those countries feel more secure today and indeed privately their governments tell us they do n't want the arms embargo lifted either indeed in their letter to the United Nations they suggested that they too wish that the arms embargo were extended the good news is the United States is going to make sure it happens we 're going to take the action that is necessary to actually deliver on what the e3 tells us they have as their objective i wish that they would join us in this we 've had this dispute about the merits of the jcpoa that 's been going on since the Trump administration 's come into place the world should know the United States will stand to make sure that the arms embargo is extended that these Security Council resolutions come back to place and that the European people will be safer as a result of the actions that the United States Government has taken today MS ortagus thank you everyone have a great day secretary pompeo great thanks everybody
"October 3, 2018","remarks Michael R. Pompeo secretary of State Press Briefing Room Washington DC October 3 2018 secretary pompeo Good morning everyone i want to update you on three issues four if you want to count the my upcoming trip to Asia including North Korea First the situation in Iraq the second a statement about the ruling this morning from the International Court of Justice and finally i want to talk about my effort to put America 's diplomatic corps back on the field to the situation in Iraq Iran is the origin of the current threat to Americans in Iraq it is to blame for the attacks against our mission in Basra and our embassy in Baghdad our intelligence in this regard is solid we can see the hand of the ayatollah and his henchmen supporting these attacks on the United States on Friday i ordered the temporary relocation of U.S. Government personnel from our consulate general in Basra i also warned the Iranian Government that we will hold it directly responsible for any harm to Americans or our diplomatic facilities whether perpetrated by Iranian forces or by associated proxies or elements of those militias these latest destabilizing acts in Iraq are attempts by the Iranian regime to push back on our efforts to constrain its malign behavior clearly they see our comprehensive pressure campaign as serious and succeeding and we must be prepared for them to continue their attempts to hit back especially after our full sanctions are re imposed on the 4th of november The United States will continue to stand with the people of Iraq as they chart a future based on Iraqi interest not those dictated by Iran even with the temporary relocation of our staff we are supporting the delivery of clean water to the 750,000 residents in Basra now let me turn to the ICJ ruling from today i 'm announcing that the United States is terminating the 1955 Treaty of Amity with Iran this is a decision frankly that is 39 years overdue in July Iran brought a meritless case in the International Court of Justice alleging violations of the Treaty of Amity Iran seeks to challenge the United States decision to cease participation in the Iran nuclear deal and to re impose the sanctions that were lifted as a part of that deal Iran is attempting to interfere with the sovereign rights of the United States to take lawful actions necessary to protect our national security and Iran is abusing the ICJ for political and propaganda purposes and their case as you can see from the decision lacked merit given Iran 's history of terrorism ballistic missile activity and other malign behaviors Iran 's claims under the treaty are absurd the court 's ruling today was a defeat for Iran it rightly rejected all of Iran 's baseless requests the court denied Iran 's attempt to secure broad measures to interfere with U.S. sanctions and rightly noted Iran 's history of noncompliance with its international obligations under the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons with regard to the aspects of the court 's order focusing on potential humanitarian issues we have been clear existing exceptions authorizations and licensing policies for humanitarian related transactions and safety of flight will remain in effect The United States has been actively engaged on these issues without regard to any proceeding before the ICJ we 're working closely with the Department of the Treasury to ensure that certain humanitarian related transactions involving Iran can and will continue that said we 're disappointed that the court failed to recognize it has no jurisdiction to issue any order relating to these sanctions measures with the United States which is doing its work on Iran to protect its own essential security interests in light of how Iran has hypocritically and groundlessly abused the ICJ as a forum for attacking the United States i am therefore announcing today that the United States is terminating the Treaty of Amity with Iran i hope that Iran 's leaders will come to recognize that the only way to secure a bright future for its country is by ceasing their campaign of terror and destruction around the world the third item putting the diplomatic team from the United States Department of State back on the field i want to talk about the fact that there are 65 nominees now sitting with the United States Senate that 's over a quarter of all the senior level confirmable positions that the United States Department of State is tasked with using to achieve its diplomatic outcomes and i want every single American to know that what senator Menendez and members of the Senate are doing to hold back American diplomacy rests squarely on their shoulders both Republicans and Democrats agree that a fully staffed State Department is critical to American national security indeed when i was before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee senator Menendez told me quote the problem is we have an emaciated State Department under this administration end of quote well we 've now done our part to fix that he now needs to do his and the Senate needs to do its part these candidates are quality candidates they are not sitting on the Senate floor because of objections with respect to their quality their professionalism or their excellence and their ability to deliver American foreign policy wave after wave of these extremely qualified nominees have been sent to the United States Senate let me give a few examples John Richmond he 's been stuck for 85 days while we try to make necessary progress on combating human trafficking a priority for this administration and a shared priority of senator menendez we have Kim Breier the president 's nominee to head up Western Hemisphere Affairs stuck for 204 days while the crisis in Venezuela and Central America continues to rage David Schenker the president 's nominee to lead the Bureau of Near East Affairs is held up while the humanitarian crisis continues and while Iran continues to undermine peace and stability throughout the Middle East Russia is seeking to prey on our elections but Ellen McCarthy a 30 year veteran of the Intelligence Community and the president 's choice to head the Bureau of Intelligence and Research sits on the Senate floor as American forces are engaged against terrorists around the world Clarke Cooper an experienced military professional designated to lead the Bureau of Political Military Affairs waits for the Foreign Relations Committee to act on his nomination you should know that as a former member i completely appreciate the Senate 's advice and consent role and their duty to conduct oversight and i understand their need to be fair and honest brokers but that 's not what is being engaged in we need these people what 's happening is unprecedented we have members of the United States Senate who for whom partisanship has now driven delay and obstruction of getting America 's diplomatic corps into every corner of the world it will impact our operations our ability we do n't have a COO the under secretary for management now coming on two years with no one filling that position and enormous complex operations keeping our diplomats safe around the world do n't have a senior leader to manage those operations there are real direct impacts of not having these people confirmed and i implore the United States Senate to take these quality talented people and allow them to do what it is they have agreed to do on behalf of the United States and with that i 'm happy to take a couple questions ms nauert inaudible we 'll start with Lesley from Reuters question thank you very much mr. secretary does the ruling of the World Court does that have any practical impact on what the U.S. is on U.S. sanctions number one and number two what other what assurances can you give that this will not impact any humanitarian aid because the Court actually said that it was not enough that the U.S. that the U.S. 's assurances were not adequate secretary pompeo The United States has been very clear we will continue to make sure that we are providing humanitarian assistance in a way that delivers for the people we have spoken very clearly about the Iranian people we care deeply about them we will make sure that we continue to afford the flexibility so that that assistance can be needed having said that the choices that are being made inside of Iran today to use money to foment terror around the world to launch ballistic missiles into airports throughout the Middle East to arm proxy militias in Iraq and in Syria and in Lebanon those are dollars that the Iranian leadership is squandering they could be providing humanitarian assistance to their own people but have chosen instead a different path a path of revolutionary effort around the world showing utter disregard for the humanitarian needs of their own people ms nauert Nick Kalman from Fox question i wanted to ask about North Korea mr. secretary The North Koreans have a new commentary saying the end of war declaration issue should 've been resolved half a century ago in light of your trip coming up will it be resolved this weekend and if not what would be the reasoning against offering this secretary pompeo so i 'm not going to comment on the progress of the negotiations on the end of war declaration or any other items only to say this i 'm very happy to be going back to get another chance to continue to advance the commitment that chairman Kim and president Trump made back in Singapore in the second week of June i 'm optimistic that we 'll come away from that with better understandings deeper progress and a plan forward not only for the summit between the two leaders but for us to continue the efforts to build out a pathway for denuclearization ms nauert next question Michel from Al Hurra question yeah thank you mr. secretary Russia has delivered today S-300 systems to Syria you said in the past that it 's a serious escalation are you planning to take any measures in this regard and my second question on Iraq any comment on the election of Barham Salih as the president and the designation of Adel Abdul Mahdi as the prime minister secretary pompeo so i 've had a chance to speak with the new speaker of the house and the new president i 've not had a chance to speak with the new the president designee as of yet i hope to do so and i am equally hopeful that they will follow through on the commitments that they made when we spoke these are people that we know pretty well they 've been around the Iraqi government scene for some time and what we talked about was building out an Iraqi Government that was an Iraqi Government of national unity that was interested in the welfare and future good fortunes for the Iraqi people not controlled by the Islamic Republic of Iran it 's something that was a shared set of objectives and i 'm very very hopeful that we can continue to work with the Iraqi people and the soon to be completed formed new Iraqi Government to deliver against that your first question was about the S-300 i 'm certainly not going to comment on our intention on how we will address that but my comments before were true having the Russians deliver the S-300 into Syria presents greater risk to all of those in the affected areas and to stability in the Middle East we consider this a very serious escalation question thank you ms nauert last question Kylie from CBS News question hi secretary question can you explain to us a little bit the practical reality of the U.S. terminating the amity with Iran and just how we 'll see that play out and then secondly just because we 're going to North Korea is there any timeframe for what the U.S. wants to achieve given that last week we heard president Trump say that they 're not the U.S. is not playing a time game but you said that you want rapid denuclearization of North Korea completed by January 2021 secretary pompeo those are entirely consistent with each other we want it fast but we 're not going to play the time game my comment about 2021 was not mine i repeated it but it was a comment that had been made by the leaders who 'd had their inter Korean summit in Pyongyang they 'd talked about 2021 when they were gathered there and so i was simply reiterating this as a timeline that they were potentially prepared to agree to president Trump 's comments are exactly right this is a long term problem this has been outstanding for decades we 've made more progress than has been made in an awfully long time and importantly we 've done so in a condition which continues to give us the opportunity to achieve the final goal that is the economic sanctions continue to remain in place the core proposition the thing which will give us the capacity to deliver denuclearization is n't changing if you heard the comments at the UN Security Council complete unanimity about the need for those to stay in place the Russians and the Chinese had some ideas about how we might begin to think about a time when it would be appropriate to reduce them but to a country they were supportive of maintaining the UN Security Council resolutions and the sanctions that underlay them that is a that is a global commitment that i 'm not sure there 's many issues in the world you can find such unanimity and so my efforts this week will be one more step along the way towards achieving what the UN Security Council has directed the North Koreans to do question and the practical fallout from pulling out of the treaty secretary pompeo we 'll see what the practical fallout is the Iranians have been ignoring it for an awfully long time we ought to have pulled out of it decades ago Today marked a useful point with the decision that was made this morning from the ICJ this marked a useful point for us to demonstrate the absolute absurdity of the Treaty of Amity between the United States and the Islamic Republic of Iran ms nauert thank you everybody we have to go now secretary pompeo thanks everyone"

"May 28, 2020",question joining us now is secretary of State Mike Pompeo mr. secretary thank you for joining us tonight your statement seemed to signal the beginning of a new era in U.S.-China relations and can you tell us tonight without getting ahead of the president that this is a serious turn away for our from our engagement with China to a much tougher approach to what they 've done to Hong Kong secretary pompeo Laura it 's great to be with you the statement that i made yesterday was something that the president and i had been working on The Chinese Communist Party is crushing what was so special about Hong Kong what made it different from the rest of China all the financial center that was there all of those things are now tragically going to be gone and as a result of that the president no longer believes that it 's justified to treat Hong Kong differently than we treat the rest of what takes place under the tyranny of the Chinese Communist Party so i think you 'll see in the coming days the president make a series of announcements with respect to this that recognizes the threat to the United States of America the American people 's security as inaudible emanates from this tyrannical regime inside of China make no mistake about it president Trump is the first president and this is n't political president Bush president Obama they all refused to recognize the threat that the Chinese Communist Party presented to the United States of America they were stealing intellectual property from us they were moving in the South China Sea all the things that you know and presidents before just turned their head they would n't do it question Biden 's foreign policy advisor you wo n't be surprised to hear this mr. secretary has some unkind things to say about your administration 's dealings with China saying president Trump has talked tough on China as you just did but he failed to make any meaningful stand against the Chinese Government and that 's why it 's no surprise China 's leaders hope for four more years of president Trump mr. secretary Biden himself then said that you 've all been weak on China because the president has an affinity for authoritarians noting that he has praised president Xi your response to the Biden camp tonight secretary pompeo nonsense this sounds like they 're pretty worried about having to defend eight years of what Barack Obama failed to do to contain the threat to America from the Chinese Communist Party question do you think China would prefer all things considered Biden to win in November secretary pompeo i can tell you this the president is going to make sure that we protect the American people from the threats that the Chinese Communist Party presents to the United States i saw none of that during the Obama Biden years question The New York Times said today that the U.S. is planning to expel Chinese grad students with ties to China 's military schools and saying that the universities are wary of a possible new red scare that targets students of specific national background and that could contribute to anti Asian racism mr. secretary number one are you worried about anti Chinese racism and number two are n't all Chinese nationals who come here are n't they all vetted in some way shape or form by the CCP so why not expel all of them at least temporarily until China somehow changes its tune secretary pompeo Laura i 'm not surprised to hear that from The New York Times frankly we 're taking seriously the threat that students that come here who have connections deeply to the Chinese state they should n't be here in our schools spying as a former CIA director i take seriously the threat of espionage inside of our country we know we have this challenge president Trump i am confident is going to take that on i do n't want to get in front of what he 's going to say tomorrow but the American people should know that the Chinese Communist Party has worked to have enormous influence here in the United States this is n't a red scare and this is n't racist the Chinese people are great people this is like the days of the Soviet Union this is a communist tyrannical regime that poses real risks to the United States and we have an obligation a duty to make sure that students who are coming here to study to take the benefits of coming to America to learn and to benefit from what we can provide to them are n't acting on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party question well i just do n't see how you prevent prevent anyone coming in here from China under the current circumstances from not being connected to the Chinese Government but i 'll move on the firing of the department inspector general this was speaker pelosi 's reaction watch when they come close to looking at behavior that might cause them some unease they fire them and secretary Pompeo said he should have fired him a long time ago because he was n't acting in the manner in which we wanted him to act what did that mean turn a blind aisle eye to wrongdoing what is it that they are afraid of secretary Pompeo was the IG fired for investigating you your dealings with staff running errands the Saudi arms deal can you go into any detail about why he was let go tonight secretary pompeo i can and i said it earlier i regret that i did n't recommend to the president earlier that he be terminated he was acting in a way that was deeply inconsistent with what the State Department was trying to do his office was leaking information we tried to get him to be part of a team that was going to help protect his own officers from COVID-19 he refused to be an active participant he was investigating policies he simply did n't like that 's not the role of an inspector general this did n't have anything to do with retaliation this was about an IG who was attempting to undermine the mission of the United States department of state that 's unacceptable and so i recommended to the president he terminate Steve Linick question and secretary finally the first terror attack on American soil after 9/11 planned abroad took place in Pensacola with three of our sailors being killed by a Saudi national who was linked to al Qaida last December why are any Saudis training with our troops who have any ties to any organization or terror related after what happened on 9/11 i just do n't understand why any of them are here training on American soil given the fact that apparently they can just go off and end up killing American sailors secretary pompeo so i 'll leave the details of the program to the Department of Defense your viewers should know the United States takes seriously anytime we have anyone coming in to train alongside our soldiers here in the United States from whatever country they 're coming in from we have a responsibility to do our best to vet them clearly this fellow got in and was a bad actor and caused enormous harm and pain to the United States of America i know the Department of Defense is reviewing that process trying to make sure we get it right we do conduct important training programs so that young American kids do n't have to fly all the airplanes all across the world to keep America safe we want to sell American armaments we want to train foreign military actors to operate that equipment so that we do n't have to put young American lives at risk i know that 's why those training programs exist we have to execute them in a way that does n't present the very risk that you identified there Laura question was that an intel failure the fact that we did n't pick up the chatter that he was involved with planning a special operation secretary pompeo i do n't know the details but clearly as this unfolded as the FBI has done its work they have concluded that he was member of al Qaida and we did n't identify that in a timely fashion question secretary Pompeo thank you so much for joining us tonight we look forward to seeing the president 's remarks i believe tomorrow on the next move with China thanks so much sir secretary pompeo thank you Laura have a good evening
"May 6, 2019",secretary pompeo so i thought i 'd do two things One i thought i 'd give you a little bit of a summary of the meeting that i had with my foreign minister counterpart from Russia Sergey Lavrov i was just with him again at the event tonight it was a good conversation we covered a wide range of issues and i think on every one have charted a way that we can begin to have positive conversations forward that we have interests that are definitely different and there will be places where we run into hard stops pretty quickly but there is no doubt there was a desire to begin to try and find paths where we can make real progress on places where we have overlapping interests as narrow as they may be and i hope we can achieve that i hope we can follow up and continue to do that i 'll see him again tomorrow for a little while and then i am sure i 'll see him again before too long as well Second some of you were asking again i spoke last night about what 's going on today and what our concerns are about the Islamic Republic of Iran we have continued to see activity that leads us to believe that there is escalation that may be taking place and so we 're taking all the appropriate actions both from a security perspective and well as our ability to make sure that the president has a wide range of options in the event that something should actually take place with that i am happy to take questions moderator go ahead question mr. secretary SECRETARY pompeo yes ma'am question you spoke about your conversation with foreign minister Lavrov just if you could give us a little bit more insight into the Venezuela portion of that conversation how far apart you are on that and whether that is one of the areas where you may have an opportunity to work together secretary pompeo yeah i do n't want to say too much other than i made clear our view that the Venezuelans deserve a democracy that is does n't have any foreign party running their country or involved in their country on a consistent basis in a military way right so we want the Cubans out we want the Iranians out Russia 's military out we 've we had that conversation and we started to talk about how our interests might be able to find a way forward i do n't know that we 'll get to the right place but we 'll have further conversations question can you speak at all about maybe you have seen the Iranians are suggesting that on Wednesday they may pull out of parts of the jcpoa do you have any thoughts about that i mean there are a lot of people in Washington elsewhere who think that this is what you guys have been trying to do to get them to pull out so that you get to another negotiation secretary pompeo yeah what we 've been trying to do is to get Iran to behave like a normal nation we laid out 12 elements of that every single one of those elements is consistent with what we ask every other country in the world to do so these are not Iran specific things like not conducting assassination campaigns around the world not sponsoring terror organizations that inflict missile attacks on Israel now 600 plus not building missile systems in Yemen these are things we ask every county to do that 's our objective that 's been our goal from the beginning i 've been working on this since i was a member of Congress our objective is to get the Islamic Republic of Iran to behave like a normal nation when they do that we will welcome them back if part of the president said we 're happy at the right time- if there 's a negotiation that needs to take place we 're happy to engage in that as well question right but do you have any specific reaction to the suggestion that they might withdraw does that do you care if they are in or out secretary pompeo they 've threatened many things over the last two years question hi mr. secretary i have a multi part question your speech this morning was very tough on China and Russia i wanted to know what was the response to your speech especially from minister Lavrov and we also spoke to the head of the Chinese delegation they insist they are a near Arctic country so i wanted to get your view on that and also what is the message on China that you will be discussing with other counterparts throughout this trip secretary pompeo so i have no earthly idea what they mean when they say they 're a near Arctic country perhaps they can provide a definition what we know is there are eight countries that form the Arctic Council that have the vested interest in things that we 're working on here on this trip all the other nations are non Arctic countries but i have n't seen the Chinese response as for foreign minister Lavrov 's response he understood what we described as factual right so you say i was tough i was laying down a data set and also urging all those nations that truly want free and open navigation who want market systems to work who want the private sector to dominate and create success and wealth and security and free passage in the Arctic all those nations who are prepared to come together and work on that we welcome those that choose another route we 're going to do everything we can to make sure that they do n't prevent what it is we 've laid out as our objectives and the objectives of the seven other council members as well at least as they have spoken with me tonight question and one more can you confirm that the carrier deployment is related to potential threats against U.S. troops in Iraq secretary pompeo i 'm going to leave talking about deployments to the Department of Defense question okay are we facing any threats from Iran or proxy forces on U.S. forces in Iraq secretary pompeo as secretary of State i have a responsibility to keep the officers that work for me safe each and every day all around the world that includes in Erbil and Baghdad in our facilities in Amman all around the Middle East and so any time we receive threat reporting things that raise concerns we do everything we can both to do all that we can to make sure that those planned or contemplated attacks do n't take place and to make sure that we 've got the right security posture the American people should know we 've done that question mr. secretary the leader of the Chinese delegation today described the Belt and Road Initiative in the Arctic as making friends and challenged the U.S. competition as making friends what is your reaction to that secretary pompeo the Chinese effort to the Belt and Road activities are about using government power to achieve national security objectives we 've said all along we have a huge economic interest in China 's success and vice versa we want that and we are prepared to allow every country to compete but it 's got to be transparent it 's got to be on a free and open basis it ca n't be with the idea that you 're going to loan a country money and then foreclose on that facility so that you can then build yourself a port or take that land and real estate that 's not appropriate we 've discouraged that we 've educated other countries around the world on that set of issues and so where there are elements of the Belt and Road that are truly building a bridge and it 's a commercial transaction it was there was a tender there was a right there was a bid process they did n't buy the guy who was making the decision so there was no corruption involved in it either we welcome China participating in those but where we see China behaving in ways that are truly not commercial but rather designed to further gain them either access entree for national security purposes we do n't think that 's what those countries are really buying moderator okay secretary pompeo go ahead ma'am question thank you very much mr. secretary did you speak with foreign minister Lavrov about any concerns the U.S. has over interference in upcoming elections secretary pompeo i did question can you speak a little bit about what it is that you shared with him secretary pompeo the same thing i 've shared with him each time we 've had a chance to cover that particular topic which is that it 's not appropriate and that we 're going to do everything we can to deter it question this is your second one on one with him or third secretary pompeo i 'm not sure we 'll have to go and check the records i 've spoken to him on the phone a handful of times as well question right no i mean but in a face to face question mr. secretary did you speak to him about the context surrounding the Russians convincing Maduro to stay when the U.S. says that he was ready to leave secretary pompeo yeah i do n't want to get into the details of any of the conversations particularly with things that we 're hoping to find a path forward on moderator okay thanks guys secretary pompeo thank you

continue to make progress in our defense and security ties with each step that brings our defense forces and our security entities closer to each other we add to the growing layers of mutual trust and confidence Today India 's defense forces carry out more training and joint exercises with the United States than with any other foreign partner we have acquired various advanced weapons platforms from the U.S. we are thus partners in building defense capability in the broadest sense of the term together we are also putting in place an enabling form a framework of closer cooperation between our militaries and our defense establishments with the announcement of the U.S. designation of India as a major defense partner of the United States and the recent decision to elevate India to STA Tier-1

that tragedy even today as we sit here our thoughts are with those who lost loved ones in our two nations as reservoirs of religious cultural and ethnic diversity and as proud maritime peoples we see the U.S.-India relationship as a natural partnership between the world 's two largest democracies a partnership that is based on convergence of enduring strategic interests and shared respect for the rules based order our discussion today is a testament to the power of free peoples i note that over seven decades ago this week the United States established diplomatic relations with India prior to its formal independence Today our partnership has become one of the most consequential in the region and in the world as prime minister Modi said at Shangri La last June a commitment to common values must be shared the foundation upon which we build a shared destiny the U.S. and India already have that foundation in our commitment to a safe secure prosperous and free Indo Pacific region where

international terrorism and we do not forget India 's leadership in the world supports our shared democratic values regionally and globally we also recognize the increasing connectivity between the

"December 19, 2017",Remarks Rex W. Tillerson secretary of State Ottawa Canada December 19 2017 SECRETARY tillerson it was n't in my remarks to hit the button and make it go green it 's green now laughter well let me say again how much we appreciate laughter all of you and our folks across the countries in how you represent us and the important role you play across this vast nation of Canada and just really happy all of you could join us on the vtc at least today but again thank all of you for what you do in furthering America 's interests and in particular i want to thank our locally employed employees as you know a lot of your colleagues they come and go they come in for their assignment and stay a couple years three years maybe and then they move on and it 's really your presence here and the continuity that you provide to this mission that allows others to come in and be successful and you maintain those relationships and you maintain our ability to operate seamlessly as people move through their assignments and move through their responsibilities here so thanks to all of our locally employed as well when i came in to the State Department on day one i had some things i said that were important to me about our values and first and foremost i said we 're going to protect our people so safety and security is extraordinarily important to me and protect our people no matter what the situations they may find themselves in and that comes with you taking personal responsibility for your own safety and security first and then look to the people on either side of you and make sure you 're taking care of them but we 've said to every mission around the world if you ever have concerns about that you should raise your hand immediately and let us know because we will address it so protecting our people Second as i said we were going to hold ourselves accountable and be honest with one another and that means we ca n't expect our partners whether it 's here in Canada or our partners within the State Department or our partners within the U.S. Government to be accountable if we do n't hold ourselves accountable for our responsibilities and be honest when we make mistakes let 's learn from them do n't be afraid of them we 're going to make them and be honest with one another when we have our disagreements let 's work through them in a very very respectful way which was the third value i wanted to really impart to people is that everyone has an extraordinarily important role to play in the success of the State Department both on the Civil Service side Foreign Service side locally employed our efms everyone has a role that 's important to us and we should respect the role that everyone plays there are no second class citizens in this State Department everyone is important and we 're going to treat each other with the respect that each of us deserves as well so those are the things that i say are important everywhere i go because it makes us stronger as an organization if we all work together in a much more effective way the last thing i want to comment quickly on the redesign of State Department hopefully many of you had a chance to either watch on the webcast the town hall we had last week or maybe you 've been able to re watch it or read the text of it but the redesign effort really was we put it underway in order to have you tell us what do you need to be more effective more efficient and what are the obstacles that get in the way of your ability to do your work what i know is we have a very capable and competent workforce of dedicated people in the State Department so if we 're not achieving everything we could it 's because there are things that are getting in the way tell us what those are so we can begin to address those and in the town hall that 's what we talked about is we 've been through three phases of listening to you setting up seven teams of 250 people of your colleagues to take all that information identified 300 projects from it they got it down to 150 we 've since gotten it down to 72 and now we 're down to 16 what we call keystone projects we announced some early things and i told the folks on the teams i said if there 's things that i can do with a stroke of a pen you bring them to me i 'll do them so we announced i think seven what we said are early actions we 're going to take things like getting everyone into the cloud so we can communicate with one another more efficiently allow people to work from different locations just help you be more efficient and more effective to things like some of our policies around MedEvac how we treat medevac cases to lifting the freeze on hiring efms but beyond that expanding opportunities for efms through the epap program we 've increased the number of people we want to push through that program because this is just a great way to deliver on our mission around the world so we had a number of things and we 're doing those and they 'll get done within the next year the 16 keystone projects have now been turned over to bureaus and tiger teams and these are a little more comprehensive projects some of them we hope will be underway and under implementation within the coming year some of them are going to take a little longer like creating a new it system it 's going to be a multi year effort but we need to modernize the tools you have we need to modernize the way you work allow you to be to do the things that you 're really good at which is use this use the brain matter and when we tie you up on things that are really wasting that capacity we 're really not serving the American people well with the investment that we 've made in you so that 's what the redesign was really about and from that we 're going to find some efficiencies and things that we 're going to capture and the whole endpoint of it is for you to have a much more rewarding career a much more enjoyable career and contribute more because you have a lot of to contribute and i know that so i 'm going to stop there because our time is a little short because i 'm late getting here and i want to have an opportunity to shake your hands as i also said on the first day in the State Department my objective is to shake every member of the State Department 's hand so you 're going to find me working the crowd now laughter thank all of you again for all your contributions and we appreciate you God bless you applause

"June 24, 2018",Interview Michael R. Pompeo secretary of State Via Telephone Washington DC June 24 2018 MS NAUERT so elise we have 10 minutes so i 'll just stand by question okay okay mr. secretary two months ago you inherited a State Department essentially on its knees really low morale the staff had really been depleted and you promised to bring the swagger back so i 'm interested in your view how have things changed do you think since you took over secretary pompeo well we 're two months in and we have made a significant amount of progress in doing a couple things First we 're reducing the amount of command and control that is i have allowed officers to make decisions we 've moved many decisions out of the seventh floor back to the professionals in the work force just as i described what i would do allowing the experts to make the judgments understanding the president 's direction and understanding my guidance so that they know commander 's intent and i think that 's made a real difference not only in our ability to execute the president 's vision but do so in a way that moves at the speed of our adversaries Second we 've made a real push to get the team staffed up as well i 've conducted a couple of swearing ins myself both for a big group of Civil Service officers as well as some swearing ins for some seniors we 're making progress on Capitol Hill too and in the coming weeks we expect we 'll have a whole much more handful of under secretaries assistant secretaries that 'll get pushed through so real progress on getting the team back on the field as well and all in all we 've also had some opportunities to be at the front of policy making we did great work the team was fantastic in Singapore helping the president execute that mission i 'd say the same about the work that we 're doing in the preparation for the NATO summit all the kinds of things that get the team excited about doing what it is they came to the State Department to do question let 's talk a little bit about North Korea in the statement Kim Jong un at the summit agreed to some very broad principles on denuclearization secretary Mattis for instance said he has n't seen any visible signs of steps yet have you been able to put more meat on the bones with specifics about what the North Koreans are willing to do and when secretary pompeo Forty years of history and now 12 days of an agreement and but i will say i will say this there are understandings that had been put together prior to the summit some that took place while the president was there in Singapore that have i think put us on the right trajectory so that we can build out a framework for success but none of that can happen none of that framework can be filled out absent the two primary decision makers in North Korea the decision maker making clear his intent to denuclearize i heard it myself when i visited there as CIA director i heard it myself when i visited Pyongyang as secretary of State and i heard it again when there was a group together with the president and chairman Kim he has been unequivocal in his statement that he 's prepared to do this we 've seen for the first time them talk about that inside of North Korea there always will be challenges and there 's work to do but none of this could have happened without the commitment of the two most senior leaders and so long as that commitment stays in place the United States is prepared to do exactly what the president said create a brighter future for North Korea and provide security assurances for the North Korean people question but i mean you yourself said obviously it 's the beginning of a process and clearly Kim Jong un had to make those declarations but you 've said that your patience the U.S. patience ca n't be infinite on this so i 'm have you given yourself any kind of i do n't want to use the word timeline but how long can you give to test the actual seriousness of those commitments i 've heard maybe you 'd like to try and get something on the table by the end of the summer just to proceed or know that maybe it 's time to reassess how you look at it secretary pompeo well elise we 'll constantly reassess that 's an ongoing process and we 'll we hope that we will have an ongoing process of making progress but look the president was clear each of the actions that we 've taken his decision to suspend the high level war games exists only so long as there is good faith negotiation progress productive results being achieved if we ca n't do that if it turns out that there 's just there 's no there 's no capacity to deliver the outcome that both presidents said they wanted yeah we 'll reassess whether that 's i 'm not going to put a timeline on it but whether that 's in two months or six months we 're committed to moving forward in an expeditious manner to see if we can achieve what it is the two leaders set out to do question you have this NATO summit the president 's trip to the UK in a few weeks it 's on the heels of the president imposing these tariffs and i mean he 's used some pretty incendiary language i think to describe some of our closest allies and now you hear the Europeans and Canada say that they just do n't think they could count on the U.S. and that 's got to make your job harder now in advancing some of your top policy goals when your friends are n't with you how are you going to mend these kind of rifts in the transatlantic alliance secretary pompeo i was a young soldier in Germany in the 1980s i remember some of the same conversation oh goodness the European partners are concerned about something that the United States is doing i say all of that right we were going to put missiles in we were going to take missiles out i could go on i could go on for hours about places where the United States and Europe have had issues where they disagreed i set that up by way of background because the things that you mentioned are in line with the kinds of discussions that America and Europe have had for decades in this instance we 're trying to make sure that the European partners share their fair burden of building out the critical alliance with NATO we 're trying to make sure that the trade arrangements between our countries are fair and reciprocal and balanced but every conversation and i have conversations with great frequency i spoke with Chrystia Freeland within the last 30 hours i spoke with the foreign minister of France yesterday morning as well and i 'm sure i 'll speak with Boris sometime this week every conversation we have is aimed at achieving a shared set of objectives the rift between the United States and Europe is much overstated there are so many things where we share common values and common concerns i am confident that we will work to achieve the goals that the president has laid out and these things that are presenting challenges today but in the end the traditional values driven alliance between Europe and the United States that transatlantic alliance will remain strong as it has for coming on 70 plus years now question mr. secretary the president is soon going to meet with president Putin the last time they met Putin said that Russia did n't meddle in the election and director of National Intelligence Coats said that he thinks though they still are and with the midterm just a few months away does this have to does n't this have to be an important agenda item at this at this upcoming meeting secretary pompeo there 's lots to talk about between the United States and Russia as you know ambassador Bolton is headed that way now i 've spoken with my counterpart Sergey Lavrov a couple of times in these first couple months whether it 's the battlefield in Syria the situation in Ukraine Russian active measures there are many topics that i 'm sure president Trump and president Putin will discuss and each of them is important to trying to put the relationship back in a place where there are a common set of understandings the Russians unlike the Europeans do n't share our value set it is a different conversation but it is still a conversation that 's worth having question but do n't i mean that aside and obviously there are a lot of areas that you do work together but do n't you do you think this is the issue that 's preventing those warming of ties really the mistrust secretary pompeo i mean they killed someone in Britain i could go on to say that there 's a single issue that 's caused there to not be a warm relationship between the two countries i think would be a misnomer but make no mistake i think president Trump agrees the Russian interfering Russians interfering in our election is something that they simply can not do i do n't think i do n't think he 'd take any umbrage with that question i have just a couple more questions mr. secretary SECRETARY pompeo of course question since the U.S. pulled out of the Iran deal the JCPOA we 've seen new designations you 've sent the State Department officials and Treasury officials out to discuss next steps and you 've been very vocal yourself about Iran including the threat from the irgc do you think a possible next step could be designating them as a foreign terrorist group there 's some talk in the administration that this should be a next step secretary pompeo there are a bunch of next steps i do n't want to get out in front of the decision making process of the president but the question that 's on the table though is n't it secretary pompeo there are lots of there 's lot of things that are being discussed things that will prove we believe very effective at the end goal which is at the end of the day what matters right right and the end goal is to convince the Islamic Republic of Iran to be a normal country it 's pretty simple it 's been funny everybody 's talked about these 12 things that i demanded of Iran they are no different from what i demand of Belgium right they 're no different than what we demand of pick a country of Singapore right be a normal country do n't conduct terrorism do n't launch missiles into international airports do n't be the world 's largest state sponsor of terror comport with nuclear requirements none of these are things that are difficult or somehow singling out Iran but rather we 're asking them to do the things that nations that are part of the community of nations do so that they can behave in normal commerce normal diplomatic relationships all of the things that we 're looking for it 's pretty straightforward and a particular designation that we make or a particular operational tactic that we undertake i 'm not going to talk about those tonight question understood i 'll just end on the immigration crisis that 's playing out you 've seen these images of the family separations some reports that parents are being sent with other kids it 's prompting a lot of outcries around the world and i 'm wondering how concerned are you about the stain this might be placing on the U.S. image and when placed kind of alongside the tariff issue concerns that there 's this perception the U.S. is protectionist closing up shop secretary pompeo yeah i have the amazing blessing of being the foreign minister for the most generous nation in the history of civilization and that goes for trade issues that goes for the acceptance of refugees it goes for our deep history of humanitarian assistance whether that 's reconstruction money or people on the ground i am not at all concerned that anyone in the world could look at the United States but understand it to be anything but a beacon of hope of democracy and freedom we have a long history of that and it has continued under the Trump administration question mr. secretary just to finish ms nauert elise we 've got to go question just to finish one last question please secretary pompeo yes ma'am question thank you so much mr. secretary just to follow on that your department has had travel advisories from some of these countries Last year you know that there was that State Department report about the need to tackle the root causes and the real drivers of illegal immigration and such as poverty violence and crime these are some of the most dangerous countries that these people are coming from and is there any thought to making a more concerted effort to demonstrate U.S. leadership to deal with some of these underlying conditions that might be a better deterrent to counter some of these images secretary pompeo there 's multiple prongs to the Trump administration 's effort along the lines that you describe and yes we are at the State Department who has a part of this doing our best to work with the Northern Triangle countries to create conditions on the ground such that they wo n't make this long arduous and ultimately often perilous trek up and through Mexico to attempt to get into the United States we do think that 's important but we 've done a lot of work with those Central American countries to address that irregular immigration and there 's always more that can be done and we 're working hard at it ms nauert elise we 've got to go question got it mr. secretary secretary pompeo elise thank you question thank you thanks for taking the time and hope to see you soon

well it 's the first time that i 've been here to Chile as the secretary of State i 'm only sorry that i ca n't spend more time enjoying your beautiful country i want to begin this afternoon by thanking Chile for being a true leader for the Venezuelan people The United States is grateful for you to hosting for your hosting of close to 290,000 Venezuelans many of whom arrived here as refugees from Nicolas Maduro 's socialist regime Chile 's efforts with the Lima Group which you just discussed are especially vital i want also to applaud president Pinera for helping isolate Maduro and for showing compassion towards innocent people fleeing the economic and humanitarian crisis in their home country in February Chile contributed significant supplies to Juan Guaido 's humanitarian aid coordinator and demanded that Maduro allow that aid to enter Venezuela i 'm going to meet with Venezuela 's refugees and see the distribution on Sunday in Cucuta Colombia you all have been great important partners and your people have been most generous The United States and its allies will not quit this fight Chile the United States and our 52 partners will continue to support ordinary Venezuelan people who are courageously standing up for democracy in their home country i also want to say a few words about Nicaragua The United States will continue to work with likeminded partners with countries like Chile to condemn the violence and repression perpetrated by Ortega and his regime i want to thank Chile for its leadership role in the OAS working group as well it 's monitoring the situation in Nicaragua and is promoting a more fully fledged democracy in that country look as for the United States and Chile and our relations our economic ties are incredibly robust and growing we share $ 27 billion trade relationship in January we celebrated the 15th anniversary of the United States Chile Free Trade Agreement the agreement 's nearly quadrupled our bilateral trade since its inception that 's truly amazing beyond trade we 're proud to work with Chile on helping small business owners create jobs in their local communities through the Small Business Network of Americas we 've seen dozens of countries in the region create business incubators Chile now has more than 50 of them and we look forward to working with Chile to lower barriers to trade and investment in the APEC region as well you noted that while Chile has host of the APEC Forum we know that it will be a tremendous success in November of this year and i want to take a moment too to thank president Pinera for the work that he did with leading the creation of Prosur and get it off the ground it 's terrific to see our partners cooperating on infrastructure development health energy combating transnational crime and managing natural disasters we 're here to help if you need us i know you 're well along your way we should all keep in mind that this is historic it is important it has not always been this way and this will benefit the lives of each of the citizens of each of those countries our bilateral relationship too on military issues is very strong Chile is an important security partner for the United States of America that 's demonstrated by our military exchanges by joint exercises by law enforcement cooperation and State Department partnership programs as well and we 've recently launched the U.S.-Chile Council on Science Technology and Innovation a truly unique public private enterprise that will propel economic growth in each of our two countries under the America Crece Initiative Chile and the United States have agreed to work together also to create greater energy security for each of our people and finally there 's the U.S. Visa Waiver Program Chile is the only country in Latin America participating in that program and the number of Chileans traveling to the United States legally has more than doubled i was reminded about the number of Americans traveling to Chile as well we 're proud of that too we should be proud of each of these developments between our two countries they are tangible signs of nations that have a close relationship and how that relationship is bearing fruit to make lives for each of the citizens of our two countries better gracias moderator via interpreter we now move on to questions John Hudson Washington Post question thank you very much a question for both gentlemen for foreign minister Ampuero as the stalemate over the fate of Maduro continues the humanitarian situation worsens and it threatens to prompt an even graver refugee crisis if this continues to worsen will you consider working with the Mexicans Europeans and others on potentially opening a diplomatic track with Maduro and secretary Pompeo did you discuss your concerns about China 's influence in Chile China does twice the business of U.S. companies here purchases vast amounts of exports and has contracts with Huawei how do you view this threat and just lastly the Guardian reported today that you have been urging Saudi crown prince mbs to cut ties with Saud al Qahtani for his alleged role in the murder of Jamal Khashoggi yet Qahtani is still actively advising MBS are you satisfied with the status quo thanks very much foreign minister AMPUERO via interpreter Chile is belongs to the Lima Group has worked inside and in full agreement with all the members of the Lima Group this group was created in order to seek a solution to the profound crisis that Venezuela is going through the efforts of Chile are within the Lima Group at the same time we as a country we believe that we need to play a role of diplomatic bridge and thus explore all the spaces for convergence existing with other players of international politics the important thing is that we share the central view the objective is restoring democracy in Venezuela as soon as possible at the shortest period possible and that none of the actions be used by dictator Maduro to prolong his stay in power so Chile is understood as a country that really seeks dialogue seeks alternatives where it can have dialogue with other international politics but always within the Lima Group secretary pompeo thank you with respect to China the topic was discussed but i did n't have to bring it up the president brought it up and the foreign minister has raised it as well i think the Chilean Government and the United States Government both share the same concerns they are a major trading partner for Chile China is a major trading partner for the United States of America we welcome that continued trade when it 's conducted on a fair free open and transparent basis for the benefit of commercial enterprises the benefit of the Chilean people or the American people we encourage that trade but make no mistake about it China 's trade activities often are deeply connected to their national security mission their technological goals their desire to steal intellectual property to have forced technology transfer to engage in activity that is not economic and one of the things we talked about is how we could share information together so that we would know which was which so that each country could protect its own citizens so that each country could stay away from occasions where China was acting in malign or nefarious ways while still understanding that trade between our countries is important it certainly benefits each of our countries we want the Chinese people to have better lives too fair free open trade is fine it is not okay to engage in predatory lending practices it is not okay to engage in transactions which are corrupt it is not okay to put technology systems in with latent capability to take information from citizens of Chile or any other country and transfer it back to president Xi 's government those are the conversations that we had today and i am confident we have a full understanding of both the risks and the opportunities associated with China your last question was about Saud al Qahtani we yesterday or this week earlier we put sanctions on Saud al Qahtani that 's all i 'll say moderator in Spanish question via interpreter Tomas Celedon hello minister we are Radio Bio Bio i wanted to ask you about the trip of president Pinera to the China for example is there a possible visit to the Huawei company is the president president Pinera going to visit that company and what is Chile 's position about a peaceful way out to the Venezuelan situation foreign minister AMPUERO as you know Chile 's position vis a vis the profound crisis and tragedy of Venezuela is that the solution is to be a political solution a constitutional solution and a peaceful one that is Chile 's position we have raised it reiterated and also it is we have stated this within the Lima Group it is a principle and shared by all the members of the Lima Group as to the visit of president Pinera to China i must say that China is our main trade partner it is insofar as investments it 's only 0.26 percent of foreign investments in Chile it 's marginal and the United States is our main investor we have a strategic relationship with the United States we have a longstanding friendship with the United States and what 's important and i must highlight is that Chile with a pragmatic policy insofar as foreign trade and seeks new markets new free trade agreements yes but at the same time we clearly know that we belong to a community that shares values values of democracy promotion and defense advocacy of democracy of human rights individual freedoms and free trade moderator thank you very much for your attendance"
"December 14, 2020",for 13 years the Iranian regime has denied knowledge of Robert A. Bob Levinson 's whereabouts or condition however senior Iranian officials authorized Levinson 's abduction and detention and launched a disinformation campaign to deflect blame from the regime Today the United States is designating two senior officials of Iran 's Ministry of Intelligence and Security MOIS who were involved in the abduction of mr. Levinson on Iran 's Kish Island on or about March 9 2007 Mohammad Baseri and Ahmad Khazai acting in their capacity as MOIS officers were involved in the abduction detention and probable death of mr. Levinson they are designated pursuant to executive order e.o. 13553 for acting for or on behalf of directly or indirectly Iran 's MOIS the MOIS was previously designated pursuant to E.O. 13553 for being complicit in the commission of serious human rights abuses against Iranians protesting fraudulent elections held on June 12 2009 the Iranian regime has a 41 year history of abducting and detaining foreigners and dual nationals as political leverage we reiterate our strong warning to U.S. citizens and dual nationals that traveling to Iran may jeopardize their personal safety the abduction detention and probable death of mr. Levinson is another egregious example of the regime 's callous disregard toward human life The United States will always prioritize the safety and security of the American people and will continue to aggressively pursue those who played a role in mr. Levinson 's disappearance we call on the Iranian regime to provide a full accounting of mr. Levinson 's fate and we will not rest until all Americans wrongfully detained by Iran are back home we hope today brings the Levinson family some of the answers and justice they deserve for more information about today 's action please see the Department of the Treasury 's press release
"December 5, 2017",Remarks Rex W. Tillerson secretary of State European Union high representative Federica Mogherini Brussels Belgium December 5 2017 moderator in progress ladies and gentlemen and welcome high representative vice president Federica Mogherini and U.S. secretary of State Rex Tillerson just had a bilateral meeting and will deliver press statements to update you on their discussions high representative you have the floor high representative mogherini thank you Maja and it 's a pleasure to welcome you Rex secretary Tillerson to Brussels the heart of the European Union after the good visits we received in spring of president Trump and of vice president Pence it 's a pleasure to welcome friends and work together we just had a good exchange of views and after this press point discussions will continue together with the foreign ministers of all the European Union member states our meeting today has confirmed the importance that the European Union and the United States attach to their close partnership and cooperation i believe we can say that it 's also an opportunity to renew collectively our commitment to a close cooperation on a number of important points during our bilateral meeting we discussed mainly four issues first of all the Middle East peace process the European Union support the resumption of a meaningful peace process towards a two state solution we believe that any action that would undermine these efforts must absolutely be avoided a way must be found through negotiations to resolve the status of Jerusalem as the future capital of both states so that the aspiration of both parties can be fulfilled we will discuss this further with prime minister Netanyahu next Monday here in Brussels and with president Abbas later at the beginning of next year as we will host both of them separately at our next foreign affairs councils we will also continue to engage with our international and regional partners including within the Quartet to support the prospectus of a resumption of negotiations towards the two states we also discussed Iran in particular the implementation of the nuclear deal with Iran i have reaffirmed the European Union view that continued implementation of the Iran nuclear deal is a key strategic priority for European security but also for regional and global security we have discussed the fact that there are other issues that we should discuss and tackle together but they are not under the scope of the nuclear agreement and therefore we are willing to address them outside of the agreement itself The European Union is willing to work closely with the United States on these issues on the basis of continued U.S. implementation of the nuclear deal it was decided that nuclear deal would have been purely on nuclear issues back some 14 years ago so now dismantling an agreement on nuclear issues that is working as the IAEA has certified for nine times would not put us in a better position to discuss all the rest on the country Third we discussed the situation in Syria looking at the wider Middle East we share the belief that it is urgent to rapidly advance towards a negotiated political transition process in Syria based on Geneva peace talks and the UN Security Council resolution 2254 i 've used this opportunity to inform secretary Tillerson about the preparations for the second ministerial conference that we will host here in Brussels in spring next year on the future of Syria and the region that will look at ways to continue supporting the Syrian people and their hosting communities not only from a humanitarian point of view but also guaranteeing political and economic support to the UN led negotiations in Geneva offering incentives towards a political solution to be reached under UN auspices in Geneva last but not least we discussed the Western Balkans we have both reaffirmed our commitment to the region which has a clear European Union perspective and encouraged continued reforms and negotiation process in the region we will now continue these conversations together with our colleagues EU member states foreign ministers i expect other issues will be addressed some of them actually were already subject to our conversation including the situation in the Korean Peninsula our cooperation in support of peace and stability in and territorial integrity in Ukraine and latest developments in the wider region of the Middle East or in Libya we also i would expect will discuss with the foreign ministers of the 28 member states our cooperation in international fora as the European Union as you know well is and remains a strong and reliable supporter of multilateralism UN system and a rules based global order thanks thank you again for the visit and for the good exchange moderator secretary Tillerson secretary tillerson well thank you very much it 's indeed a pleasure to be back in Brussels and i think meetings like the one that was just held between the high representative and myself illustrate again the strong commitment that the U.S. has to the European alliance and the important role that the European alliance plays in our shared security objectives and vice versa as well the partnership between America and the European Union i think as everyone knows is longstanding it is one that 's based upon shared values shared objectives for security and prosperity on both sides of the Atlantic and we remain committed to that i think during our meetings today as the high representative mentioned there were a number of important issues discussed and views exchanged and in particular on North Korea we appreciate the resolute stance of our European allies to send a message to the regime in North Korea of our we do not accept the nuclear weapons program that they have undertaken and we view that it is an important objective for all that there be a denuclearized Korean Peninsula and again this economic pressure will continue until either North Korea reverses its course certainly to encourage talks to get underway to do so our shared objectives in terms of defeating ISIS are important but not just defeating ISIS in Iraq and Syria but defeating ISIS globally and i think continuing our discussion on joint efforts to combat terrorism wherever it raises its head and we certainly see the results of ISIS caliphate and this long reign of terror that they have carried out in Iraq and Syria which is now coming to an end we also discussed as the high representative mentioned our joint efforts under the JCPOA to hold Iran fully compliant with the terms of the JCPOA fully enforce that agreement but at the same time recognizing that Iran is carrying out a number of other destabilizing actions in the region and we 've seen this recently with ballistic missiles being fired from Yemen which it 's our belief are sourced from Iran their support for the Houthis and the destabilizing effect that that has in Yemen we also know of Iran 's destabilizing effect of exporting weapons and militia to Syria an area of conflict and their ongoing support for Hizballah a terrorist organization these issues and activities of Iran can not be ignored and can not go unanswered and we intend to continue to take action to ensure Iran understands this is not acceptable to us and we look forward to working with European partners in that regard as well it 's a threat i think to many of our shared values as a NATO member the United States is very happy and pleased to see NATO EU cooperation continuing to evolve and deepen since the joint declaration was signed last year and we 'll certainly have an opportunity for further discussions around that today during the NATO meetings we know our security is strongest when allies and partners shoulder their fair share of the burden and that 's why we continue to call on others to increase their defense spending that is towards a shared objective and serves everyone well our European allies are also steadfast supporters of the peace process in Syria and as the high representative just confirmed our support for the full implementation of UN Security Council resolution 2254 a significant effort has been underway as the defeat ISIS campaign succeeds to move Syria to a process of reconciliation as called for under 2254 and we 're pleased to see talks resume in Geneva under the leadership of the UN representative Staffan de Mistura and we 'll support those talks in all ways possible to keep those parties at the table to find and chart a new course forward for Syria that will serve the will of the Syrian people like any good relationship this one requires a lot of attention and i know the high representative is very committed to this relationship her tireless efforts at communication with the United States and the United States Government at all levels is important and we view it the same and that 's why i 'm here as well today and appreciate the time that she 's given me and the important exchanges we 've had and much of this will continue throughout the day as we have a full agenda ahead of us so thank you moderator thank you very much this concludes this press conference
"September 16, 2020","ms ortagus thank you so much and good afternoon everybody i know we 're having this call right after we did the press conference with the secretary and we have another briefing later today so apologies that we 're piling all of you up today we 're going to try to allow for as much time as possible for q&a inaudible many of you have it but just want to reiterate of course that this is an on the record briefing with special representative for Venezuela and now also for Iran Elliott Abrams while this is an on the record briefing the contents of this briefing are embargoed until the end of the call please this is actually Elliott 's first press briefing since he assumed both roles he will of course begin with an introductory statement and then we 'll turn over to your questions just a reminder you can press 1 and then 0 at any point in time on inaudible to enter the question queue so with that i 'll go ahead and turn it over to Special Representative Abrams mr ABRAMS thanks Morgan i want to begin with a comment on Venezuela and the fraudulent election for the National Assembly now scheduled for December 6th and then turn to Iran none of the basic conditions for free elections exist in Venezuela opposition parties have been stolen and regime agents appointed to run them the national elections commission is completely under regime control freedom of the press does not exist repression and intimidation by the police and colectivo gangs continues there are not reliable and tested voting machines in Venezuela the rules of the game were recently changed by the regime which created over 100 new National Assembly seats and changed voting district lines i could go on and this is precisely why interim president Juan Guaido and a coalition of 37 parties has said they would not legitimize this fraud by participating in the election needless to say those conditions will not be cured merely by postponement fraudulent elections are no less fraudulent if held a few months later a cornerstone of our policy in Venezuela has been to support the diverse and broad array of democratic actors fighting for liberty and democracy there to those who have decided to participate in the National Assembly elections our message is that you have a special obligation to demand the necessary internationally accepted conditions for free and fair elections and to speak openly about the repression and corruption of the Maduro regime we are able to distinguish between democratic actors who differ on strategy and people who work with the regime to undermine democracy we will not hesitate to apply the full force of U.S. sanctions to the latter group as we have been doing in the last few years to all Venezuelans who struggle for free elections and a restoration of democracy we continue to pledge our full support and as you know secretary Pompeo will be visiting all of Venezuela 's neighbors Colombia Brazil and Guyana in a trip that starts tomorrow i would draw your attention to the report of the United Nations Human Rights Council today by the UN 's Independent Fact Finding Mission on Venezuela this United Nations mission quote found reasonable grounds to believe that Venezuelan authorities and security forces have since 2014 planned and executed serious human rights violations some of which still quoting some of which including arbitrary killings and the systematic use of torture amount to crimes against humanity close quote and then in an extraordinary statement for a UN report it says quote the mission has reasonable grounds to believe that both the president and the ministers of people 's power for interior relations justice and peace and for defense ordered or contributed to the commission of these crimes documented in this report close quote these crimes says the UN crimes against humanity start at the top now we 're aware of reports of additional tankers heading to Venezuela from Iran and that 's another reminder of how Maduro has destroyed Venezuela 's economy and infrastructure through incompetence and mismanagement and corruption and created the need to import gasoline into this oil rich country the installed crude oil refinery capacity in Venezuela is 1,300,000 barrels a day but that corruption and neglect have reduced actual gasoline refined to less than 5 percent of that so the regime turned to another international pariah Iran shipping it gold to buy gasoline as you know virtually all UN sanctions on Iran will come back into place this weekend at 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time on Saturday the 19th the arms embargo will now be re imposed indefinitely and other restrictions will return including the ban on Iran engaging in enrichment and reprocessing related activities the prohibition on ballistic missile testing and development and sanctions on the transfer of nuclear and missile related technologies to Iran the secretary said just a couple of hours ago that we expect all UN member states to implement the UN sanctions fully and respect the process and obligations to uphold these sanctions we 'll have a lot more to say on this in detail on Monday this is a good moment to reflect on the almost religious commitment of some countries to that nuclear deal but five years of JCPOA meetings have not moderated Iran 's tactics or choices at all it 's time for peace loving nations to recognize this reality and join us in imposing sanctions on Iran it is astonishing that anyone would think or have thought it sensible to allow the arms embargo on Iran to expire next month given that regime 's role in destabilizing Iraq Syria Yemen and Lebanon and its continuing support for terrorism i want to close with the story of Navid Afkari the young Iranian wrestling champion in the summer of 2018 Navid joined a peaceful protest along with his two brothers the regime arrested all three of them and tortured them into confessing for a murder that took place when they were in a completely different part of town the regime wanted to make an example of them and as you know executed Navid last weekend this is a terrible reminder of the brutal and despotic regime with which we are dealing i would remind you that yesterday Siamak Namazi celebrated his 49th birthday in the notorious Evin Prison that marked 1,800 days 1,800 days since the Iranian regime first took him hostage siamak his father Baquer and Morad Tahbaz remain innocent victims of the Iranian regime and we work every single day to gain their release thanks and i 'm happy to take questions on either Venezuela or Iran ms ortagus wonderful okay great First up in the queue is Gabriela Perozo VPITV question hi good afternoon thank you so much for this opportunity do you think that this new report presented by the UN independent mission will help Europe not allow itself to be manipulated by this new strategy of Maduro to release political prisoners to achieve a dialogue do you believe that the UN General Assembly will be a good platform to reaffirm the strategy around the interim president Guaido and another question will secretary Pompeo 's trip to Brazil and Colombia bring some surprises maybe something new against the Maduro regime thank you mr ABRAMS thanks well as to the secretary 's trip bringing surprises of course if i said anything it would n't be surprises there will be a briefing about the trip and i will let Senior State Department official and during the trip the secretary speak about the trip on your first question i sure hope so this is an extraordinary report to come from the United Nations we 're not used to seeing such tough reporting coming directly from the United Nations so i hope it will have an impact on any government that is thinking about its policy toward the Maduro regime this begins with a meeting an important meeting tomorrow of the International Contact Group on Venezuela which will obviously issue a statement as they always do so i think this will remind people of the nature of the regime and remind them that the release of some political prisoners in some cases partial release because they 're released to house arrest or the charges have not yet been dropped and many others have not been released this is a regime move that as your question really suggested is a tactic that does not change the nature of the regime and its systematic human rights violations which are documented in this very substantial report as to the UN General Assembly i do n't know whether it will affect how the assembly votes on Venezuela i really hope it will and i think that there will be a lot of governments around the world that will read this report and particularly for those who do n't follow Venezuela closely it will be a revelation ms ortagus great thank you so much we 'll now turn it over to Matt Lee AP question thanks Elliott i have a my questions are about Iran you guys can say all you want that you expect UN member states to go ahead and join you in enforcing the sanctions that you say are going to be reimposed but the reality of the situation is that no one no other country exception for maybe Israel and maybe the Gulf some of the Gulf countries think that you have the legal standing to do this and so they 're not going to enforce them so why is it wrong for people to think that you guys are just barreling ahead with something that is going to create major problems for the UN in terms of its credibility and the credibility of the Security Council as well as U.S. credibility thanks mr ABRAMS thanks Matt secretary Pompeo did address similar questions and i 'll answer your question as best i can but i would urge you to take a look also at what he said at about noon today in the press conference with foreign secretary Raab i do remember a couple of years ago the many many expert opinions suggesting that the unilateral imposition of sanctions by the United States would have no effect on Iran and as the secretary said boy all you have to do is look at the Iranian economy to see that that is not true and the reason that it was not true is that whatever foreign ministries said individuals businesspersons banks companies around the world paid attention to the sanctions and did not wish to violate them i think you will see that happen again with respect to the reimposition of UN sanctions i think that all of those individual actors around the world will take a look at the text of those sanctions and what the United States is saying and will realize that for them the UN sanctions must be regarded as back into effect so i do think that this will have a very significant impact i do n't and i think it 's the United States first of all is not isolated with respect to the arms embargo i think and we know from our conversations there are many countries around the world that feel exactly as we do including in Europe about the expiration of the arms embargo there was a letter from the Gulf Cooperation Council all the members to the UN Security Council saying please do not let the UN arms embargo end and as the secretary said what we 're dealing with here is an effort on the part of the United States to overcome the diplomatic malpractice five years ago that suggested it would be a good idea to allow Iran to import and export any any arms it wanted to main battle tanks combat jets in only five years that 's what we 're up against and that 's why we 're taking this action ms ortagus thank you so much okay i 'm going to try not to mispronounce the name here haik h a i k Garats g a r a t s from Argus Media question hi this is Haik Gugarats with argus media thank you i have two questions for you sir one on Venezuela and one on Iran on Venezuela what is your current thinking on the diesel for crude swaps are your efforts to persuade companies not to participate in those working and if not do you think at some point a government directive to end it via sanctions will be necessary and on Iran snapback i 'm trying to understand the practical effect given that you just said unilateral U.S. sanctions pretty much already ended most dealings between Iran and all the other countries so what is it exactly that your snapback will do in ending any new transactions is it humanitarian deals or what exactly will be the practical effect thank you mr ABRAMS thanks on the latter question not humanitarian deals there are carveouts in all all U.S. sanctions for humanitarian goods such as food and medicine but i 'll give you an example of where we expect a practical effect the arms embargo and as you know it was the position of the United States that the arms embargo should be extended and had it been extended we would not have had to snap back to restore the full panoply of UN sanctions so one practical effect we believe will be to say to arms manufacturers and traders around the world that if you engage in business with Iran the very full force of these new or rather restored sanctions will be felt immediately they will be placed on you so i think you will see that happen with respect to diesel and the impact of U.S. sanctions i would just note first you may have seen the decision by Tipco the asphalt company which has been a significant consumer of Venezuelan oil and deals with the regime and PDVSA has announced that it is getting out of that business we 're looking very carefully at the diesel question and we note for example that the Maduro regime is consistently shipping diesel and other oil products to Cuba i have no announcements to make today but i think it 's pretty well known that we 're reviewing the whole diesel question ms ortagus thank you Carol Morello Washington Post question inaudible Elliott you just said that arms dealers around the world will realize that the restored sanctions will be felt immediately are you making concrete plans now for secondary sanctions after the embargo officially expires next month and do you have any thoughts on what the impact having a confrontation with U.S. allies Russia China Iran and the Security Council itself might just two weeks before the election might have on the vote itself mr ABRAMS First in our view the UN sanctions snap back on Saturday at 8:00 p.m. so the October i think it 's October 18th the date for the end of the UN arms embargo becomes a less significant date as to whether we are making concrete plans we are in many ways and we will have some announcements over the weekend and more announcements on Monday and then subsequent days next week as to exactly how we are planning to enforce these returned UN sanctions so you 'll see that we actually have some announcements this week but more on Saturday and then more on Monday and next week i do n't think that this action on the part of the United States to enforce Resolution 2231 will have a negative impact on the UN Security Council unless other members of the Council continue to take the view that the UN sanctions have not returned and can be ignored and whether those countries will in fact ignore the UN sanctions remains to be seen we followed the procedures exactly set forth in Resolution 2231 word for word ms ortagus okay thank you we now have Meghan Gordon from Platts question hi thank you yes on the Iranian fuel cargos heading to Venezuela do you plan to target those with additional civil forfeiture cases like we saw earlier this summer or any other additional measures or does the fact that they 're using Iranian tankers limit any options for stopping them mr ABRAMS well our first goal was to make sure that no one other than Iran would engage in this trade and it is interesting actually a lot of people have gasoline for sale certainly China and Russia have gasoline for sale but U.S. sanctions have led them to the view that they should not be engaged in that trade and the Greek shippers have gotten out of that trade so we 're left only with Iranian tankers Iranian owned flagged crude vessels that are engaged in that trade in a limited way there are three on the way that 'll provide a few weeks of gasoline if you wanted to prevent the return of the kind of shortages that are now so common in Venezuela you 'd have had to leave Iran yesterday with another three tankers you would need a shuttle service which we have not seen so we 're watching what Iran is doing and making sure in the first instance that other shippers insurers ship owners ship captains realize they must stay away from that trade ms ortagus thank you Joel Gerhke Washington Examiner question hi thank you for doing this i just wanted to follow up on the Iran question i wonder what practical actions do you believe that European countries could take to deter or interdict to Russian and Chinese arms sales to Iran would it be additional Iran related sanctions on the Russian defense industry or new sanctions on Chinese companies would these actions find their legal basis solely in the UN arms embargo or could they be taken under the EU arms embargo authority or some other initiative and then kind of related to that setting aside the particular legal dispute with the UN Security Council i wonder are there any negotiations perhaps from British officials any proposals for how the how U.S. and European countries might cooperate to mitigate the perceived threats that all parties perceive from these arms deals mr ABRAMS yeah well the European countries told us the EU-3 and others as well that they do n't want the arms embargo to end but they were unable to take any action that kept the UN arms embargo in place there 's a separate EU arms embargo what the European countries could do would be number one to enforce the UN sanctions that returned this weekend Secondly they could maintain a UN sorry an EU arms embargo on Iran and they could do that indefinitely Thirdly they could cooperate closely with us as and when they see any effort by Russia China or anybody else to sell arms to Iran we again we will be enforcing those UN sanctions in as much as the EU-3 and other Europeans have said to us they really wish the UN arms embargo remained in place they should take action to make sure first that no EU country engages in an arms sale to Iran and second they should be helping us to enforce the UN sanctions and i do think that if the EU joined us in maintaining those sanctions obviously it would have an impact on companies that were contemplating a sale ms ortagus okay great thank you let 's see next up in the queue Muath Alamri no response ms ortagus Muath Alamri operator go ahead your line is open no response ms ortagus okay i 'll give you one more chance muath no response ms ortagus okay question hello ms ortagus hi go ahead question yeah thank you i would like to ask you about the intelligence report that Politico has published about the story about the Iran weighing to attempt to assassinate the U.S. ambassador to the to South Africa as a retaliation for the Soleimani killing if you could elaborate what is the impact could happen and what those targets that Iran is looking to attack mr ABRAMS i would say first that i would say first that no one should be surprised by reports in the press that Iran is contemplating or planning acts of terrorism this regime has decades of blood on its hands for terrorist attacks not only near Iran but all over the world then we remember the plan to attack the Saudi ambassador here in Washington other than that i would only say that the State Department and the U.S. Government more generally are always very attentive to the need to protect American officials around the world but i do n't want to comment beyond that on this particular set of press reports ms ortagus okay thank you Nick Schifrin PBS no response ms ortagus Nick Schifrin operator mr. Schifrin please press 1 0 ms ortagus oh sorry i thought he was still in the queue okay if he 's not in the queue then let 's go over to Lara Jakes New York Times i believe she 's on operator One moment okay ms. Jakes your line is open question hey Elliott hey Morgan Elliott could you please speak to the case the curious case of Matthew Heath this former military marine i believe who the Venezuelan Government is saying is a U.S. spy i mean assuming you wo n't speak to whether or not he 's an agent certainly if there is an American who is being kept held captive in Venezuela i would assume that is something that the United States Government is trying to untangle and get him back home could you please bring us up to speed on the those efforts thanks mr ABRAMS well there 's a limit to what i can say because i do n't have the privacy waiver that would allow us for that would allow us to say a bit more obviously we are always concerned when we get a report about an American who has been jailed in a foreign country and Venezuela is particularly difficult because we do not have an embassy with a consular section in Caracas i do n't think there 's much else i can say about this case except that from everything i 've seen it 's i can say that the United States Government did not send mr. Heath to Venezuela ms ortagus thank you i think i want to try to get Nick back on Nick Schifrin he said he was on the line PBS can we get him back on operator go ahead your line is open question thanks Morgan hey Elliott thanks for doing this logistically as i understand it the resolution requires the U.S. to veto a resolution that would extend the sanctions the snapback sanctions so just making sure that 's right is the U.S. planning to introduce its own resolution that it would then veto or do you think that 's not even necessary ahead of Saturday night and a larger question if those other countries do n't enforce these sanctions do you fear that dilutes other Security Council sanctions including of course the ones you 've been talking about and working on when it comes to Venezuela thanks mr ABRAMS i think you 're misreading 2231 i think 2231 is pretty clear that any JCPOA participant state can send that notification to the Security Council about Iran 's failure to meet its responsibilities and sanctions return 30 days later unless a resolution has been adopted that continues the lifting of sanctions which 2231 brought the sanctions in all the previous resolutions 1737 1929 and so forth so one way of getting there is somebody introduces a resolution to continue the sanctions and they 're vetoed that resolution is vetoed the other way of getting there is that somebody introduces the letter to the council notifying it and then the resolution to continue the lifting of sanctions does not pass well it 's not passing no one has introduced it so the sanctions snap back i do think 2231 is pretty clear on that a the introduction of a resolution and its veto is not required and if you go back to the speeches of various officials made five years ago they were very clear in saying that one country we in this case can bring back the sanctions without the action of any other so i do n't think that 's i do n't think your interpretation of it was right as to the impact on other Security Council sanctions well needless to say we hope not what the United States is doing here is following the exact text of the UN Security Council Chapter VII resolution Resolution 2231 and if other nations do not follow it i think they should actually be asked your question whether they do not think they 're weakening the structure of UN sanctions ms ortagus great thank you so much okay i know we 're just we 're running out of time here i 'll try to fit one or two more in if i can we had sorry guys let me just the queue up back here Nora Gamez from The Miami Herald question inaudible this i just have a question about Venezuela the U.S. has said it 's willing to negotiate with Maduro his exit does the fact that the UN believes he has committed crimes against humanity makes this hypothetical negotiations less likely mr ABRAMS i think it 's a this UN report is a reminder of the nature of this regime that 's why the United States introduced a few months ago our framework for a democratic transition because we believed and still do that you need to get a transitional government in Venezuela that can hold a free election if you look at this UN report and the nature of the crimes that it attributes to Maduro and the Maduro regime you would really have to ask yourself what is the chance that Maduro and his regime are actually going to hold a free election our conclusion was that there was no chance which is why we said there needs to be a transitional government for the purpose of holding in six months nine months whatever twelve months a really free and fair presidential election we 've also in the we 've said that to many many governments around the world and it 's one of the reasons why we think that the notion that there will be a free election on December 6th really defies both logic and everything we know about the nature of this regime the problem is that some people seem to think that the time is the issue so okay not December 6th maybe postpone three months and then we can organize a free election we do not believe that it will be possible to organize free elections under this regime ms ortagus thank you okay let 's see i had somebody from ABC here oh yeah David Alandete from ABC question thank you Morgan thank you ambassador Abrams i wanted to ask you there 's a meeting this Thursday of the Grupo de Contacto with the European Union it seems that the high commissioner Borrell mentioned that maybe maybe a postponement of the election would guarantee the European Union sending observers he did n't say this himself his office said it to some journalists in Brussels and i wanted to know if what you think can happen from this meeting of the Grupo de Contacto and if the postponement of the election was acceptable for the European Union what would the United States diplomacy say to that thank you very much mr ABRAMS there are two issues here the first as i said a moment ago is timing no one believes they could even if they wanted to hold a free election in December that they could actually organize one they need 30- or 40,000 voting machines they need to import them from someplace Five million Venezuelans are now outside the country and millions more have moved inside the country so the updating of the electoral register is an enormous task that could not possibly be completed by December again even if you were really trying to do it with good will but there 's a second issue and here 's where i worry a bit about some of the things that we 've heard from Brussels the mere postponement is not enough the electoral conditions must change as i noted at the beginning and i wo n't go through all of them again but remember that they 've changed the rules of the game recently the electoral commission is completely in Maduro 's hands there 's no freedom of the press the major opposition parties have been taken over and regime people have been made into the top officials of those parties so there are no conditions for free elections what am i worried about what i 'm worried about is a deal under which the European Union essentially says if we 're not going to monitor elections in December but if you postpone then we can probably monitor once you make that agreement if you do then you 're leaning very far forward toward monitoring and if along the way this is the danger if along the way Maduro arrests this woman Maduro jails that man Maduro refuses to let these people out of prison you 're you do n't want to say well we made a mistake and we 're not going to monitor and we 're going to pull back there will be i think a normal human tendency to try to minimize or overlook both violations so that you can go forward with your agreement if you postpone then we will monitor i think that would be a terrible deal and i think the EU should in the International Contact Group meeting tomorrow and in other statements it makes be extremely clear that timing is just one factor and the fundamental conditions have to be put in place i have sometimes thought in listening to the phrase basic conditions or what are the minimum conditions that what some EU spokesmen are saying is well of course in Europe we need to have all the conditions for free elections but in Venezuela you just need basic minimum conditions and that 's the wrong attitude Venezuelans are entitled to free and fair elections just as much as anyone in Europe ms ortagus well thank you Elliott you 've been really gracious with your time i 'm going to have one more question and then many of you will be dialing in to our next briefing with Senior State Department official so can we go to Eli Lake Bloomberg for last question do we have Eli on question yeah can you hear me MS ortagus okay operator your line is now oh he just took himself out One moment please press 1 0 again ms ortagus Eli i think we still have you operator go ahead Eli your line is open question okay thanks so much for doing this Elliott really quick it 's almost 10 months since the U.S. killed Qasem Soleimani have you seen a deterrent effect as a result of that is Iran as threatening as it was before that action or can you comment on that at all mr ABRAMS yeah i would say that action did a very great deal to restore American deterrence and i would say a certain degree of caution on the part of Iran prior to that they or some of them were in doubt about the willingness of the United States to conduct an activity like that and i think some other countries in the region were too and i think it 's much clearer now that the United States is truly willing to act to defend itself and its allies and to act against terrorism in the region and so i think as we 've looked at Iranian reaction since then i ca n't mindread but there are indications of some degree of caution on the part of Iran about what reaction from the United States a particular Iranian action might evoke ms ortagus great well thank you everybody for dialing in today we 've gone quite over thank you Elliott so much for the extra time and we 'll have another briefing this afternoon with Senior State Department official and i hope you all dial in then thank you mr ABRAMS thanks bye"

"November 16, 2018","secretary pompeo good afternoon everyone it 's my honor today to welcome minister Klimkin to Washington to breathe new life into the U.S.-Ukraine Strategic Partnership Commission and to reaffirm our unwavering support for a democratic Ukraine it 's good to see you again i saw you in Paris it 's wonderful to spend some time with you again today and i know you had a series of very productive meetings with our team as well Ten years ago we initiated this dialogue to advance our mutual interests and grow our bonds as free nations Today we achieved progress on three pillars of the relationship and i 'll talk about each of them First security and countering Russian aggression second the rule of law and humanitarian issues and finally economic and energy security we 're bolstering Ukrainian democracy growing prosperity and better equipping Ukraine to counter Russia 's aggressive designs on that country Ukraine is at a critical point in history during the 2014 Revolution of Dignity the Ukrainian people sacrificed their lives to protect their independence and self determination they demanded that their government maintain Ukraine 's European orientation and end pervasive corruption Ukrainians continue to fight this battle as they work to build a modern democratic western state they know that a free and well governed nation is a hard won victory but it 's worth it The United States supports those efforts and honors the achievements that you have made thus far that same spirit of courage and determination drives Ukrainians to continue to fight to uphold their national sovereignty and territorial integrity in the face of Russian aggression Ukraine has no greater friend than the United States in this regard as we made clear in the Crimea Declaration this past summer the United States will never accept Russia 's attempted annexation of Crimea we will continue to impose consequences against Russia until Moscow fully implements the Minsk agreements and returns control of Crimea to Ukraine as a show of our resolve just last week we imposed a new round of sanctions on the supporters of Russian aggression in Ukraine our dialogue today also included important discussions on the rule of law anticorruption relations with neighbors and human rights we explored how we can work together to promote democratic principles press freedom and judicial independence these are all staples of a thriving free society advancing these crucial reform goals will ensure the ideals of the Revolution of Dignity are permanently woven into the fabric of a democratic Ukraine by strengthening your political institutions these reforms will also make Ukraine more resilient in the face of Russian aggression and finally we had a chance today to discuss energy security and economic reforms we 'll keep working together to stop the Nord Stream 2 project that undermines Ukraine 's economic and strategic security and risks further compromising the sovereignty of European nations that depend on Russian gas we do not want our European friends to fall prey to the kind of political and economic manipulation Russia has attempted in Ukraine since it cast off its Soviet shackles foreign minister thank you for being here today foreign minister KLIMKIN secretary Pompeo dear friends i am very glad to come to Washington to meet with you and to launch together the work of our Strategic Partnership Commission thanks again Mike for the invitation it 's a pleasure to be here This year marks the 10th anniversary of the U.S.-Ukraine Charter on Strategic Partnership the commission unites a number of ministers and governmental agencies on both sides such as defense commerce energy foreign affairs that work together to advance our broad and intensive agenda and the shared goals enumerated in the charter we 've had a very good and productive discussion today on the whole range of issues that both our countries work on i would like to stress that our strategic partnership is based on the common values that our two countries share and today 's meeting showed once again that Ukraine and the United States have become real allies and friends Today our countries stand shoulder to shoulder in countering Russia 's aggression this aggression takes many forms it 's the hot war in Ukraine where Russia occupied Crimea and parts of Donbas the war that took off over 11,000 people the war which continued this very moment in the very heart of Europe it also takes the form of trying to undermine democratic institutions in the U.S. and in Europe including Ukraine with presidential and parliamentary elections coming up into Ukraine we are looking at U.S. experience in countering Russia 's election meddling as well as sharing with the U.S. our experience in dealing with this risk we share the peace through strength approach and appreciate the U.S. leadership showing the strength in the face of Russian malign behavior i would like to especially thank secretary Pompeo once again for the Crimea Declaration which was a demonstration of exactly such leadership and strength we must not falter in the face of the aggressor and pressure and the sanctions must remain in place until Moscow changes its course however so far we do n't see any change on the contrary we see Russia 's subversive activities in the Sea of Azov we see shellings of our land and lives being lost every day we see Ukrainian citizens held as political prisoners in Russian jails and today we discussed ways how Ukraine and the U.S. will continue to work together to strengthen our resilience we appreciate the U.S. support in strengthening our defense capabilities both through training of our military and through providing defense equipment as partners on those Budapest memorandums thereby Ukraine gave up the third largest nuclear arsenal in the world the memorandum blatantly violated by Russia we will continue to further develop our security and defense cooperation we will also continue to focus including in the framework for the Strategic Partnership Commission on strengthening as the secretary has just said the rule of law in Ukraine eradicating corruption which is our most fundamental challenge aside from countering Russia 's aggression and further support of our civil society we are thankful for U.S. support of Ukraine 's steady progress towards eventual membership in NATO and the European Union and we appreciate the U.S. support and understandings that today Ukraine is defending not only territorial but also spiritual independence so thank you again for the support of our spiritual independence and to create autocephaly of the Ukrainian Church we have also talked today about further expanding and giving a boost to our trade and investment as well as actual cooperation our trade increased 1.6 times over the past year we can think about new ideas in this field such as exploring the possibility of a free trade area in the future thanks again Mike for this invitation thank you for your very strong personal support i look forward to welcoming you in Ukraine for the next round of our Strategic Partnership Commission in not too distant future thanks a lot secretary pompeo thank you wonderful to see you great thank you"

"January 11, 2018","special briefing i. steven Steve goldstein under secretary for public diplomacy and public affairs Brian Hook director of Policy Planning Press Briefing Room Washington dc January 11 2018 under secretary goldstein hi it 's Steve Goldstein i 'm the under secretary for public diplomacy and public affairs i will be doing the briefing today and i 'm joined by Brian Hook of note i 'm happy to say that Heather 's son is doing much better and i would expect her back at the podium next Tuesday and no one will be more happier to see her than I. laughter what we 're going to do first is have Brian give you a briefing on Vancouver he 'll then take four or five questions and then he has to go back to his office and then i will come back up answer additional questions and then we 'll go around the world trying to respond to whatever you might have so first let me introduce Brian Hook who i think many of you know is the director of Policy Planning for the secretary Brian mr hook thank you Steve good afternoon to all of you the vancouver foreign ministers meeting on security and stability in the Korean Peninsula will be held in Vancouver on January 16th The United States and Canada are convening the meeting to demonstrate international commitment to diplomatic solutions to the escalating threat posed by DPRK 's nuclear and ballistic missile programs the ministerial the goal of the ministerial is to provide a practical mechanism mechanisms to exert continued pressure on the Kim regime while demonstrating that diplomatic options remain open and viable the invitation list is largely based on countries who are UN Command sending states which are the countries that sent combat support and/or humanitarian aid to support the Republic of Korea during the Korean War there is growing evidence that our maximum pressure campaign is being felt in North Korea they are feeling the strain and we believe that this pressure campaign remains the best avenue to force change in Kim Jong un 's behavior and to get him to the negotiating table for meaningful discussions among the issues we will be discussing is how the international community can thwart North Korean efforts to evade UN sanctions through smuggling as you know with the secretary 's patient diplomacy together with our allies and partners around the world the administration has increased pressure on the DPRK to new and unprecedented levels combined with previous UN Security Council resolutions over 90 percent of North Korea 's publicly reported exports as of 2016 are now banned many countries are further taking unilateral action to hold the DPRK accountable and let me give you a few examples Malaysia kicked out North Korean laborers Qatar and Kuwait halted work visas to North Koreans the UAE has completely severed diplomatic ties Peru Spain and Italy have all expelled ambassadors Portugal froze all diplomatic relations with the DPRK in July as i think as i 've mentioned in prior interactions with you in every bilat the secretary brings up North Korea and he has done that since the time that we had reached agreement on a North Korea strategy in the national security cabinet and we have seen a lot of this very patient and day by day diplomacy yield a lot of results the goal of this pressure campaign is to persuade the North Korean regime that the only way to achieve peace and stability is to abandon its current path and embrace meaningful dialogue about a different future the sending states ministerial comes amid the backdrop of renewed talks between North Korea and South Korea over the North 's participation in next month 's Winter Olympics president Moon told president Trump that the initial talks on Tuesday went well we will wait to see where this engagement eventually leads as always we are hoping for a diplomatic solution secretary Tillerson has been clear that we do not seek regime change or collapse nevertheless we will not rest until the world is assured that the DPRK 's pursuit of nuclear weapons has been verifiably abandoned and then with that brief scene setter i 'm happy to turn it over to questions under secretary goldstein Matt Lee question i just i 've got to defer to my colleague Matt Pennington who is going to be on the trip so under secretary goldstein okay Matt Pennington question yeah i 'm over here Brian has the complexion of this meeting in Vancouver changed because of the diplomacy that started between the North and the South i mean will there be a greater emphasis on seeking a diplomatic engagement with the North rather than just focusing on sanctions pressure mr hook i do n't think it 's i do n't think it 's going to change the agenda i think you saw that the president and the secretary were both very pleased with the interaction between the North and the South we believe that that was brought about through in some part because of the pressure campaign as i said we believe that the sanctions that the North Koreans are starting to feel the bite of a global pressure campaign and we think that this creates the kind of conditions that lead to discussions between the North and the South about the Olympics we are going to be at this Vancouver ministerial doing an assessment of progress to date we 'll be discussing sanctions the sanctions that we have done multilaterally and unilaterally to date and their effectiveness and what we can be doing in the coming year we 'll be discussing the importance of nonproliferation and we 'll be discussing diplomatic options to achieve our goals of a denuclearized Korean Peninsula under secretary goldstein Andrea question what steps would be considered to try to thwart smuggling especially the kind of refueling we 've seen at sea would any kind of a naval operation be considered some have suggested including a former NATO supreme allied commander that a naval blockade is actually the only option mr hook at Vancouver we will be discussing maritime interdiction we continue to explore all options to enhance maritime security and the ability to interdict maritime traffic those transporting goods to and from the DPRK that support the nuclear and missile program and we will be discussing with our partners and allies the kind of steps that we can take on maritime interdiction and also to be cutting disrupting funding and disrupting resources and maritime interdiction helps us to disrupt resources and then the financial side helps us to disrupt the financing of their nuclear and missile program under secretary goldstein okay arshad question how do you hope to effectively crack down on smuggling to or by North Korea on trade on financial transfers without having China at such a meeting and did the United States favor or oppose China attending the meeting mr hook we have had regular discussions with the Chinese about the problem that we 're having about resources and funding making its way illegally to North Korea we 've been very pleased that China has certainly given much fuller implementation i think they have closed some sanctions gaps they are doing a better job of implementing the UN Security Council resolutions we 've had four UN Security Council resolutions in this administration that the Chinese supported we also know that this is necessary but insufficient and we need to be doing more to deal with vessels that are engaging in prohibited activities under UN Security Council resolutions One of the things that we 're looking that we hope that the UN can list some of these vessels for port entry bans and we think that that will demonstrate seriousness of purpose if we can start having more of these vessels listed so that we can then they can be banned from entering other ports we need to drive up the consequences for any vessels that are engaging in this kind of activity with respect to China and the Vancouver ministerial we will give them a readout of this ministerial after it 's over and we have been in discussions with the Chinese and the Russians leading up to this Vancouver ministerial this is based on sending states China and Russia were not sending states question well they were but on the other side right mr hook they were not UN sending states under secretary goldstein okay let 's question would n't your ability to get under secretary goldstein here we have a couple more questions Nick question to impose pressure been much greater with the Chinese there mr hook no but they were n't UN sending states that was my point question would n't it be better would n't your ability to exert pressure be greater if you had with you the largest trade partner and the regional heavyweight China mr hook well China is working with us this is not an alternative to everything that we are doing this ministerial will enhance and strengthen all of the efforts underway to achieve our policy goals China has the same policy goal in terms of ensuring that North Korea does not become a nuclear weapon state and acquire the means to deliver a nuclear warhead so there is broad agreement in the international community about the end state this Vancouver ministerial is something which supports all of our efforts collectively and we have been in touch with China and Russia on this ministerial and we will be giving them a readout when it 's over and a discussion and it will be very helpful i think that they will welcome a lot of the actions that come out of the discussion because it all rolls up into the same policy end state under secretary goldstein thank you Nick question Brian what is a clear sort of concrete deliverable you hope to get out of this meeting is it progress toward a new Security Council resolution is it charting a path forward on new sanctions and as part of this campaign is the U.S. considering advocating for secondary sanctions against major Chinese banks to further clamp down on North Korean finances mr hook we very much want the Vancouver ministerial to be an assessment an assessment of where we 're making progress and areas where we need to do more and so this will not be this is not just for sort of pr value we want very concrete steps we will be discussing concrete steps that we can all be taking to help increase the campaign as we 've said from the beginning this is a campaign of global and escalating pressure it 's a maximum pressure campaign and that campaign will continue in some form or another until we achieve our policy goals our security objectives and the great benefit of a meeting like this is it allows many many countries to come together and to discuss interdiction to discuss nonproliferation to discuss maritime activities to discuss denying the regime the resources and the funding that it needs and will also be to talk also to talk about diplomacy and how all of that fits together so that we have we certainly have put the credible military threat on the table and but our definite preference is for a negotiated solution under secretary goldstein thank you we have kylie atwood will get the last question kylie question on Chinese banks on banks on Chinese banks Brian question Two i 'm sorry go ahead question can you just answer the question on mr hook oh on Chinese banks well we have in our discussions i remember when the secretary in his initial discussions with the Chinese we have been very clear with them about the action that we need them to take against individuals or entities that are under Chinese control that are contributing in whatever fashion to helping or facilitating or supporting North Korea 's nuclear and missile program we 've asked them to take action they have taken action in some areas we take secondary sanctions we will impose secondary sanctions when we need to and that 's something which the Chinese understand very clearly from our conversations under secretary goldstein okay Kylie Kylie gets the last question question okay so two quick questions you said that the global pressure campaign that 's been put forth by the U.S. is one of the reasons that 's created the conditions that have led to these discussions between North Korea and South Korea can you expand on that because it seems from an outsider 's perspective that it 's actually just inviting them to talks without them actually committing to anything that you guys want them to commit to and then the second question is are U.S. and North Korea talks a possibility at the Olympics mr hook on the first question you 're saying that you do n't think that the pressure campaign has i 'm not sure what you mean question how is it creating the environment that led to these led to these talks if it 's just looking like North Korea can say they want talks can show up at the Olympics and they 're not really facing the heat that you guys or making the changes that they want you want them to make mr hook well North Korea came to the South and said that they would be willing to talk about the Olympics and so we were pleased that they had that conversation it was largely limited to the Olympics it is you 've seen what the president and the secretary have both said about it the president has said that he believes that this that this climate that we have helped to create through the pressure campaign promotes and enables and encourages this sorts of interaction but this was largely limited to the Olympics and there really is i do n't think i do n't read much beyond it other than that and your second question was question is it possible to consider U.S.-North Korea talks at the Olympics mr hook no under secretary goldstein okay thank you so much Brian mr hook okay question thank you mr hook thanks under secretary goldstein thank you again Dave welcome okay so let 's go over the trip just briefly the secretary will leave on Monday the meetings will take place in Vancouver on Tuesday on Wednesday morning he will go to Stanford where at noon he will give a speech with open press to the Hoover Institute he was invited by secretary Rice and secretary Shultz will co host the speech the secretary will speak and then he will take questions on the podium from secretary Rice and former secretary Rice and former secretary Shultz and then after he will then come back to New York to Washington laughter also tomorrow morning at 10:30 the secretary in the Acheson will swear in a class a new Civil Service class and that will also be open press now let 's i can start with whatever country you 'd like or we can continue questions question let 's start with Iran under secretary goldstein okay question so i 'm just curious if you could when the secretary was asked about Iran sanctions waivers the president 's decision this morning he said that he 's going to get a chance i guess to make that decision today are some have taken that to believe that a decision and an announcement will happen today is that is that an incorrect reading or do you still expect this to be tomorrow under secretary goldstein well there have been ongoing discussions about this for at least a week the secretary Tillerson secretary Mattis and the president and others started this at Camp David and the secretary 's been at the White House almost every day he was there yesterday for many many hours the decision meeting is this afternoon and from that the decision will be made i 'm not sure when the announcement will be whether it will be tonight or whether it will be tomorrow but we do expect a decision to be made later today question are you persuaded by what the European Union today their statement because they advocated for to stay with the deal are you in any way influenced by that under secretary goldstein the president and the secretary have all the facts in front of them and ultimately it will be the president 's decision they 'll have a long discussion about this today as they have all throughout the week and a decision will be made Andrea question Steve how much has have the protests if at all complicated a decision given widespread analysis that any withdrawal or blowing up of the Iran deal at this point would help the hardliners and undermine any efforts towards moderation in Iran under secretary goldstein i do n't think we should conflate the two the fact is that the we 've encouraged we 're encouraged that president Rouhani in Iran has allowed social media sites to open we still encourage the Government of Iran to allow protesters to dissent and we hope they will continue to do so we do not support any crackdown on dissenters Felicia question in October when the Trump administration rolled out the strategy Tillerson said that he hoped by January there 'd be an agreement on legislation trigger points i think is how he described them obviously that legislation 's not going to happen this week but i guess one is the secretary satisfied with the progress and two if January was the old deadline does the administration and the secretary have a new deadline for when they want to see that happen under secretary goldstein well there are thank you there are 20 more days in January but first let 's get to the decision today and at that point we 'll make a further determination and i 'll try to give you an answer to that next week question how involved is the secretary i know that there 's been a lot of meetings at the White House and the NSC on the legislation negotiations how involved has the secretary been under secretary goldstein secretary 's very involved in all decisions relating to foreign policy rich question Steve how much do the INARA and congressional discussions have to do with the president 's decision that he 's going to make apparently today under secretary goldstein we have not halted funded funding to UNRWA the decision is under review and there 's still deliberations taking place i think the we are looking at this decision for what it is and the president will make a decision based on all the information he has including information from the secretary of State and from other from the secretary of Defense and others but we are confident that we will get to the right place i would expect an announcement either later today or early tomorrow morning question what 's the right place under secretary goldstein well that 's for the president to announce and that will occur soon question well laughter you have your question Off mike under secretary goldstein hold on yes ma'am question can i just follow up on that as well question can i go back under secretary goldstein well hold on let 's let everyone ask have the opportunity to ask one question first question Off mike question can i go back to Vancouver meeting under secretary goldstein yes question First of all could you please clarify if China and Russia were invited to this meeting under secretary goldstein no China and Russia were not invited to the meeting but China and Russia will be informed of the results of the meeting right when it is over most important to note is that China and Russia strongly support what we are doing we 're all together in the in belief that the that North Korea must provide a plan for denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula question and could you please explain under secretary goldstein we all share the same view question can i clarify one thing question they 'll under secretary goldstein yes sir question in response to Rick 's question which i think was about UNRWA under secretary goldstein okay question in other words aid to the UN under secretary goldstein thank you question right you then said i 'm confident that we 'll get to the right place under secretary goldstein yes question when you said i 'm confident that we 'll get to the right place were you talking about Iran and the decision on Iran sanctions waivers under secretary goldstein i was answering the question that was asked of me QUESTION Off mike question no i was actually asking INARA yes under secretary goldstein oh i 'm sorry question inara yes under secretary goldstein i apologize for that question yeah yeah yeah under secretary goldstein inaudible question but then it sounded at the end that you were answering also inara so under secretary goldstein yeah question so does that change the answer question so so getting to the right place under secretary goldstein that question applies to what to inara and Iran or to UNRWA under secretary goldstein it implies it applies to all decisions that we make look inaudible question laughter under secretary goldstein the inaudible secretary of of course it does question Off mike under secretary goldstein the secretary of State along with the president along with the National Security Council and others who were involved regarding Iran have met all this week the decision meeting is occurring currently there will be a decision announced on that as it relates to any other issue we follow the same process in making a decision question but that decision is going to be today or tomorrow as well the Palestinian under secretary goldstein no no i did n't say that question okay under secretary goldstein i said that no we did not i did not say that that decision would be made that deliberations are still taking place and we 've not made a decision on that question can i just follow up on the Palestinian under secretary goldstein yes question yeah Nazira Karimi Afghan independent journalist under secretary goldstein yes ma'am question may i ask you about Iran situation impact to Afghanistan any impact to Afghanistan situation Iran currently situation under secretary goldstein we will get back to you on that question sure question Steven question yes on the under secretary goldstein alicia question Vancouver meeting under secretary goldstein yes question Brian mentioned maritime interdiction would be a topic of discussion under secretary goldstein yes question are you going to be discussing something akin to a blockade and if that 's the case is there any concern that North Korea would take that as an act of war under secretary goldstein i think we 'll look at all things on the table all things will be on the table but we 've been very clear that the sanctions are have been effective and what we want is for North Korea to come to the table we are pleased that they are sending athletes to the Olympics we 're pleased that people from North Korea are able to go and witness the Olympics and that they 'll be marching as part of the community of nations but that is a start at some point they need to come to the table and at some point soon with a plan for how they 're going to denuclearize this peninsula and it has to be irreversible so until that point occurs all things are on the table question hi under secretary goldstein yes hi question we 've talked a little bit about who 's not going to be at this summit under secretary goldstein yes question but can you offer us a little more specificity on who has said that they 're attending and at what level under secretary goldstein i will get back to you with the names but South Korea will be attending question i have quick follow up so Chinese foreign ministry is describing this meeting as Cold War thinking because you only invite UN sending countries what 's the reason behind it and what 's your response to Chinese criticism that this may harm the joint international effort on North Korea under secretary goldstein well i have n't seen that statement but with all due respect that is not how we or our Canadian hosts would describe that meeting we will once the meeting is over we will call we will talk to our counterparts in China and Russia we will inform them we have been given no indication that China and Russia 's position has changed regarding these sanctions and their position is what our position is yes question so it 's been announced that General Mattis will be at the welcome dinner i believe what is his role going to be at the event under secretary goldstein to welcome the countries that are at the event question just welcoming he 's not going to be at any of the in the meetings participating under secretary goldstein general Mattis of course will likely participate in some of the meetings i refer you to the Department of Defense but we 're pleased that general Mattis is able to be there question secretary Mattis question on North Korea under secretary goldstein One second question inaudible North Korea again under secretary goldstein i 'm sorry question on North Korea under secretary goldstein yes question recently president Trump mentioned that open to talks with the North Korea but not without preconditions has the U.S. change any policy toward the North Korea under secretary goldstein no we have not changed our position that the we 're pleased that North Korea has agreed to come to the participate in the Olympic Games that 's good for South Korea and it 's good for North Korea and it will also be good for the figure skaters and others from North Korea who come to South Korea and are able to interact with people from all different nations including the United States question but do you you open to talk with North Korea with the preconditions or without the preconditions what is it under secretary goldstein our position 's very clear North Korea needs to come to the table the president stated what our position is the secretary 's reiterated it we need negotiation Matt i 'm sorry you had something no okay question Turkey Turkey question i do but not on this under secretary goldstein okay go ahead question Katrina Manson from the Financial Times under secretary goldstein hi Katrina question hi can i just check when you say that China and Russia were not invited is there anything in Canada suggesting they should be invited and then U.S. in fact saying no and can i confirm that China will in fact attend some side meetings in Vancouver under secretary goldstein i will get back to you on that but Canada is hosting the meeting and we concurred with the decision dmitry question thank you under secretary goldstein please use the microphone question wait can i follow up on that one particular point please Steve under secretary goldstein okay okay elise question Canada made the decision not to invite China and Russia or was that made in conjunction with you and Canada under secretary goldstein it was made in conjunction and again we will inform China and Russia after the meeting where things stand they are we are all in agreement that these sanctions need to be implemented we are also in agreement that the sanctions are working but and we 're also in agreement that North Korea must come to the table dmitry question a port port entry under secretary goldstein can you use the microphone if you do n't mind question a port entry bans idea that ambassador Hook mentioned has have you discussed it with the Russians and the Chinese in any way shape or form under secretary goldstein is your question have we discussed with the Russians and Chinese question a port entry ban a ban for some of the North Korean vessels to entry to enter under secretary goldstein every question ports abroad under secretary goldstein yes sir everything that 's discussed at the meeting we will share with our with Russia and with China along with all the other countries that are at the meeting as i said after the meeting we plan to contact China and Russia Josh question ambassador Pete Hoekstra in the Netherlands had his debut for the Dutch media it did n't go real well just to start off does the State Department agree with his earlier comments that politicians have been burned as a result of Islamist movements and that there are no go zones in the Netherlands under secretary goldstein no The State Department does not agree with those statements that is not the language that we would use question would you like the ambassador to maybe retract those given all of the controversy it seems to be causing under secretary goldstein the ambassador when he was an ambassador designate in December when this initially started issued a statement on Twitter that said for the last 17 years i 've been passionate about confronting the global threat of terrorism the person Josh is referring to is Pete Hoekstra who was sworn in yesterday as the ambassador to the Netherlands former member of Congress from Michigan this has been a long struggle we still have much to learn i made certain remarks in 2015 and regret the exchange during the Nieuwsuur interview please accept my apology i was born in the Netherlands and love this country it will be the greatest honor of my life to serve as the United States ambassador to the Netherlands i look forward to the opportunity to learn to listen and to move on in the spirit of peace and friendship with the people and the leaders of the Netherlands merry Christmas and a blessed New Year his position on that has n't changed i agree that yesterday that the ambassador did not answer some of the questions that were asked of him he recognizes that he is going to do a long form interview tomorrow that is the plan with a Dutch outlet and he also plans over the weekend to be available within many of the communities in the capital including Muslim communities and it is a great honor for ambassador Hoekstra to serve the Netherlands and we are hopeful that we can move beyond this he 's excited about the opportunity to be able to help the people of the Netherlands question well the quickest way to move beyond it it seems to me would be for him to actually say that he was mistaken in or incorrect in 2015 when he made the comments that have got the Dutch upset no under secretary goldstein he did say in December that he made certain remarks in 2015 and regrets the exchange question yeah but the remarks under secretary goldstein and i 've indicated question but the remarks that he made in 2015 were n't just something that you apologize they were wrong they were it was factually incorrect under secretary goldstein right but i 've indicated that question apologizing for them is one thing under secretary goldstein yes question but he was asked yesterday to retract them under secretary goldstein yes question which he did not do under secretary goldstein but i have indicated clearly that that is not the view of the department question does that mean that the department has told him that he should retract his comments under secretary goldstein the department has had conversations with the ambassador the ambassador wants to get this behind him he is very committed to serving the people of the Netherlands as a United States representative this is the greatest honor of his life and he and again he will be giving question i hope he 's committed to serving the people of the United States under secretary goldstein he will be giving question which is why he 's there under secretary goldstein i appreciate that he will be giving an interview tomorrow and he will be available throughout the Netherlands and i have advised as i 've advised most people that when reporters are in front of you just as you are in front of me that it 's always good to answer questions laugher question so does that mean does that mean that he will question can i inaudible question when he is asked in this interview tomorrow which he certainly will be i 'm sure he will be under secretary goldstein i think you should question if he still thinks or still believes that there are no go zones in the Netherlands and that politicians have been set on fire under secretary goldstein right question will he answer the question under secretary goldstein you should turn into that interview tomorrow i 've been very clear on what our position is question why ca n't you say right now that those statements were inaccurate under secretary goldstein well i did say that i said that 's not the position of the Department of State question no that 's different it 's different not the position of the Department of State is different from those statements are inaccurate under secretary goldstein i 've been very clear that that 's not our position that is not language that we would use and that 's not language you will ever hear me use or heather use from this podium question well yeah but under secretary goldstein let 's question can you just say that it 's wrong under secretary goldstein let 's do one at a time i 'm sorry question can you just say that what he said in 2015 on this television show is just factually incorrect it does n't have any basis in truth under secretary goldstein i 've been very clear on what our position is question i under secretary goldstein i 'm not sure how i can be more clear other than to make the point that is question you can say before he under secretary goldstein that is not the view question before the election before he under secretary goldstein well question in 2015 three years ago almost that he made some comments on a television show that were incorrect under secretary goldstein the ambassador said question that 's how you get it behind that 's how you get it behind under secretary goldstein right i appreciate that pr advice and that 's i share your view by the way laughter question well under secretary goldstein the ambassador made remarks in 2015 and he said very clearly that he regrets the exchange question yeah but that does n't mean that he thinks he under secretary goldstein i think you all if you tune in to the interview tomorrow you will under you will he will address this issue this is those comments were not the position of the State Department and you will never hear those words from this podium or in any form let 's question well do you expect him to say question Off mike under secretary goldstein let 's i 'm question do you expect him to say that he was wrong under secretary goldstein let 's let some other matt let 's let some other people ask some questions with all due respect let 's let some other question why do you have ambassadors representing under secretary goldstein let 's let some other people question the United States to countries where they have previously made factually incorrect statements about the country where they are sent to represent the United States why as a matter of policy does the State Department have an ambassador who 's made inaccurate statements about the country he 's now working in on behalf of the U.S. people under secretary goldstein the ambassador made mistakes in 2015 made comments that should not have been made he recognizes that he apologized in December he is doing an interview tomorrow we are he is honored to be the ambassador the he 's been received well by the Dutch Government and we hope that he can be received well by the people of the Netherlands and we have made clear to the ambassador that that he must move to get this behind him and he definitely understands that he feels great remorse yes sir question thank you sir on Turkey two quick questions question inaudible under secretary goldstein hold on okay i 'll get back to you Dave question no but i 'm on this topic this is Turkey under secretary goldstein well okay okay Dave question sorry under secretary goldstein i 'll get right back to you i apologize question Yesterday yesterday the State Department issued its new way of doing Travel Warnings travel advisories under secretary goldstein yes yes question Holland or the Netherlands was given a one rating as a place you do n't need to exercise any particular precaution going to obviously you 've just said you do n't believe there are any no go zones in Holland whatever the ambassador may have said are there any no go zones because of Islamic extremism in any country of the European Union under secretary goldstein i 'll get back to you on that question that 's not the language that we would use as i said yes sir question thank you Two quick questions on Turkey One is is there any way you can first describe to us the relationship between Turkey and U.S. and the second question is Turkish president Erdogan just yesterday once again accused U.S. Government for plotting another coup and many leading Turkish officials have been accusing Turkey Almost day in and day out these accusations are coming from Ankara to your government can you respond to these accusations under secretary goldstein it 's in our natural national interest for Turkey to be a stable democratic prosperous and reliable ally we do n't believe language as you indicated moves that helps us move to that goal that it 's understandable that Turkey like most countries seeks good relationships with its neighbors we 've long supported and we continue to support Turkey 's democratic development because we believe that respect for the rule of law judicial independence and freedom of the press are sources of Turkey 's strength and expand our potential for partnership question can i ask a question on the Palestinian issue under secretary goldstein yes you may question thank you sir you talked about that they are still deliberating on the issue of UNRWA the Palestinian under secretary goldstein yes sir question relief and works agency under secretary goldstein yes question now are these deliberations are they just internal deliberations or are you talking to other contributors like European countries like the UN itself and so on to see how this money in the past has been spent on which areas and so on under secretary goldstein i can not go i ca n't give any further guidance than what i did on Tuesday in making decisions we ask all interested parties to provide us with their view before a decision is made those deliberations are continuing question but one more under secretary goldstein yes in the back i 'm sorry question one quick follow up if i may under secretary goldstein hold on i made our point clear on this question question i understand another i mean it 's under secretary goldstein i want to be fair to everybody in the room and we have at least 10 people asking questions question it 's the palestine Israeli issue i mean i have more questions i 'm sure under secretary goldstein i appreciate your comments but i 've been clear on our position yes ma'am question i i that 's not on this issue sir under secretary goldstein yes ma'am question sir on another issue under secretary goldstein i 'll come with all due respect i 'll come back to you but let 's let other people ask a question question but we focus on one issue at a time under secretary goldstein yes ma'am question was North Korea invited to the Vancouver meeting was it ever considered and is there a bilat scheduled for secretary Tillerson and foreign minister Kang Kyung wha under secretary goldstein North Korea was not invited to the meeting North Korea has not indicated that they are ready to put down their nuclear weapons and to denuclearize they are that has to occur before they 're they would be invited to any such meeting i would i do believe that the secretary of State and the foreign minister of South Korea will have an opportunity to interact One second right behind you i 'm sorry question hi i 'm Cindy Saine with Voice of America under secretary goldstein hi question following up on the travel advisories Russia did not seem to be too pleased with its ranking in the new system and the foreign ministry put out a statement saying that if U.S. citizens go to Russia en masse they would be able to see with their own eyes there is not a trace of what U.S. officials are routinely trying to frighten them with do you have a response to that and possibly an update from ambassador Huntsman being here under secretary goldstein well those are two completely different issues question they are under secretary goldstein ambassador Huntsman was here as part of a routine set of visits to Washington D.C. he met with the secretary he was on the hill for a day and a half he met with different people in the department including me i had the opportunity we had the opportunity to talk for over an hour about public diplomacy matters and his support for how we can help enhance what we 're doing within Russia and so that relates to that as it relates to your question regarding the Russia 's hyperbole concerning visitation if people would read the look on the website and see what was said the only goal in the rating system is to help people be safe as they visit countries we if people want to visit Russia that 's within their purview as long as they follow the appropriate get the appropriate passport and visa that absolutely and book the appropriate plane flights or boat trip that 's their opportunity and so i just do n't want to engage comments like that they do n't they really do n't serve any purpose and in some ways they discourage Americans from wanting to go there yes ma'am question there are reports that prime minister Abe is considering not attending the Olympics because of recent statements by president Moon about the issue of comfort women is the State Department talking to prime minister Abe to encourage him to attend the Olympics under secretary goldstein i will get back to you on that we hope for the country of South Korea that the Olympics is a well attended event it 's an opportunity for all the nations to come together in sport and to support our athletes that is what the Olympics is about it 's about the figure skaters and the skiers and the people that do slalom and biathletes and all others question luge under secretary goldstein and the luge and every other sport that we in this room like question curling under secretary goldstein curling Andrea mentioned curling without a doubt a very interesting sport my spouse likes that question indoor rowing under secretary goldstein there 's no indoor rowing in the Winter Olympics laughter but in two years i will come back to you and talk to you about that in the Summer Olympics if i 'm so lucky laughter Nike question well if i may i would like to ask a quick question on Serbia regarding the visa rejection of the its army chief 's visa application to the United States i understand the State Department usually do n't comment on individual visa case that said could you please address the possible repercussion and then respond to Serbia Government 's comments that there would be consequence in the bilateral relationship under secretary goldstein we just do n't discuss any issue relating to the issuance of a visa question so but on the same subject the also apparently the foreign minister of Argentina was denied a visa to come for medical treatment and there are instances in which you do discuss visa cases visa denials and those instances are when the person who was rejected speaks publicly about them about it and that has happened i do n't know about the Serbia case but it has happened in the Argentina case can you speak to that under secretary goldstein i ca n't but i 'll be glad to get back to you on that question can i under secretary goldstein i will come back to you but let 's yes ma'am question hi Chia from United Daily News Taiwan under secretary goldstein yes question you have expressed concerns about China 's unilateral actions to fly through M503 route but have you talked to your Chinese counterpart about this and Taiwan has been asking to communicate with China but they have n't responded yet so have you encouraged Chinese to talk with Taiwan under secretary goldstein i will get back to you on that question just a follow up on the question under secretary goldstein okay go ahead question can question you can never go wrong taking a question on Taiwan question has U.S. contacted icao on this under secretary goldstein say that again i apologize question has U.S. contacted icao regarding this unilateral announcement because this is about aviation safety issue Taiwan government hope that other friends and other government can help to convey the message under secretary goldstein right so when decisions are made we communicate with all affected parties yes question Yesterday the Democrats on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee came out with this report about Russia 's influence campaign abroad and among the recommendations was a call for a like an international effort with allies on the kind of following the model of the coalition to defeat isil is the State Department is the secretary of State behind that kind of a recommendation under secretary goldstein we have a Global Engagement Center in the Department of State that where whose funding was increased actually and whose job it is to work on the interdiction of ISIS and Boko Haram and others who pose a threat to United States citizens and the citizens of our allies and we also are very focused on the issue of disinformation and we are happy that Congress agrees with our Intelligence Community 's assessment question is he is the secretary behind a creating an effort specifically to counter disinformation from Russia under secretary goldstein we have a mechanism designed to do that called the Global Engagement Center as i indicated which is funded and whose job it is to focus on the issue of disinformation whether it comes from Russia or China or any other country Andrea question well in the report it specifically criticized the State Department for not activating that Global Engagement Center adequately saying that Congress had put the money in but that it has not seriously taken its mission and is behind the curve on this and said that the president is guilty of negligence under secretary goldstein well question for not doing what the other countries have done to challenge Russia and defend against Russia under secretary goldstein we take the threat of disinformation very seriously The Global Engagement Center reports to the under secretary for public diplomacy i meet with them very frequently they 've been doing excellent work as it relates to the issue of disinformation and along with interdiction and they frequently brief the Hill i received several questions on that during my hearing and we respect senator Cardin but we do n't share the view that the Department of State or the administration is lacking in that regard i can tell you that i and my colleagues are very committed to this issue that it does n't what that what that report is missing is a list of the of what we have done and what we continue to do we are awaiting additional funding which we have been told that we will receive from the Department of Defense over the next couple of months that has n't prevented us though from doing the work that we 've had to do question so the report was focused not only on disinformation under secretary goldstein yes question it talked about a range of behavior that really runs the gamut of what they call hybrid threats that disinformation is just a small part of that under secretary goldstein well that 's what you asked about though but i appreciate that go ahead question well no i mean i said a global influence campaign under secretary goldstein okay question and that in their view includes things like corruption and money laundering and transnational crime groups and all kinds of other efforts that they 're saying that it 's not just a disinformation campaign but it 's kind of a broad spectrum threat and what they 're what they 're saying what the Democrats on the Foreign Relations Committee are saying is that it requires a different approach than what the State Department is doing under secretary goldstein it we believe we have a mechanism in place to address these issues and we are going forward in doing that we are very respectful of senator Cardin and the Democrats on the committee and we 've read the report with great interest but to say that we are not moving forward on this that this is not an issue of importance to us is just not accurate in all of the areas that you mentioned Josh question Ecuador has granted WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange citizenship wondering if you have any reaction to that decision he 's obviously been holed up in their embassy for quite a long time and is the U.S. still looking to arrest and charge mr. Assange under secretary goldstein right well that 's the decision the decision to grant Julian Assange citizenship is a decision between Julian Assange and the country of Ecuador and we do n't discuss whether we are considering bringing Julian Assange to the United States for trial question what so that means that you the administration has no feelings no thoughts on the Ecuadorian decision at all under secretary goldstein well we have feelings and thoughts on most issues question right so what are they on this specific issue under secretary goldstein laughter but on this specific question and maybe not feelings but thoughts under secretary goldstein right but on this specific issue we do n't discuss what our actions will or will not be question i 'm not asking about your actions under secretary goldstein i appreciate that question i want to know whether you think it 's a good thing or a bad thing that the ecuadorians under secretary goldstein but that 's just not something we would discuss at the present time this decision just occurred within the past two hours i believe question yeah another question regarding Pakistan policy what will be the next step of decision of United State toward Pakistan if Pakistan still keep its old policy toward Afghanistan and United State any update under secretary goldstein as it relates to the decision that we made question yeah under secretary goldstein we would hope that Pakistan would come to the table and that they would turn over those terrorists that we have asked be turned over we 've indicated very clearly that we are that we believe that can happen we 've only suspended the aid we have not reallocated the money so now it is the job of Pakistan to take seriously their commitment to us and most importantly to the people of Pakistan who would most be hurt by this by another terrorist any terrorist activity and come forward so our position has n't changed they have not yet come forward to answer your follow up question question One follow up on this under secretary goldstein yes sir question can you tell us now precisely what is the amount of foreign military financing that the U.S. State Department will suspend pursuant to the president 's decision you had previously said i think or an NSC spokesman said it was about a billion dollars including under secretary goldstein yes question but it 's a week later and i wonder if you now have the actual number under secretary goldstein i 'll get back to you with the number you 're correct though that is the number that we use something close to a billion dollars it 's a series of dollars in different areas that would have to be put together question yeah under secretary goldstein but again our hope and we have n't reallocated the money our hope is that Pakistan will do the right thing for the people of Pakistan because they should want to root out terrorists in their country as much as we want to root out terrorists in their country question on Pakistan under secretary goldstein yes sir question and i brought this up earlier i do n't know if there 's an answer to it or not but do you have anything on any kind of recent interaction with the Government of Pakistan on the situation the case of dr. Afridi under secretary goldstein i do n't but i will check on that and i will get back to you later today question thank you under secretary goldstein yes ma'am question thanks so much on Pakistan we understand that officials have said they will stop sharing intelligence and already have stopped sharing intelligence from sources on the ground on the Afghan border with the U.S. what 's your reaction to that have they informed you of that are you making efforts to see if that 's correct and take action under secretary goldstein no they have not informed us of that and i checked on that at a quarter to two Eastern Time and as of that point that had not occurred question do you anticipate that to happen do you anticipate the unilaterally cut off the supply under secretary goldstein because as Matt noted i have feeling i am hopeful that Pakistan will do the right thing and turn over the terrorists and honor their commitment question Tunisia under secretary goldstein yes sir question you 've been very vocal from the podium about asking the Iranians to release people that have been arrested at protests under secretary goldstein yes question and also to give them free access to the web Tunisia has arrested 600 protesters in recent days do you do the tunisians have a right to protest in the same way also Saudi Arabia has held blogger Raif Badawi now for three years and has lashed him he wanted access to the internet under secretary goldstein well the protests that are currently going on in Tunisia relate to longstanding economic issues we believe that people in all countries should have the right to dissent and we encourage nations to allow that to occur and that would include Tunisia as it we question raif Badawi in Saudi Arabia under secretary goldstein we do n't question Just two days ago was the third anniversary of him being jailed for 10 years under secretary goldstein yes any person who is in the media who is trying to do their job and has been punished for participating in trying to provide information to that country through free through freedom of the press should be afforded appropriate considerations and it 's not just as it relates to the blogger in Saudi Arabia but there are journalists imprisoned in many countries and those countries should try to address these issues as quickly as possible question could i do one more follow up sir you stated that U.S. Government is supporting Turkey as a stable democratic reliable ally yet we hear these accusations are coming every day do you think there is a problem an issue in communication channels between these two allies U.S. and Turkey under secretary goldstein i 'll we believe that the government of turkey could be a strong ally to the United States and communication with all nations is important that 's as that is as far as i can go on that question could be i mean are n't they a strong ally question is it not now under secretary goldstein yes question they 're a NATO ally under secretary goldstein yes they 're a NATO ally absolutely question are they a strong ally under secretary goldstein yes they 're a strong ally but there 's always work to be done with each as we work with each nation and they tell us their concerns and we tell nations our concerns and we work together to try to reach agreement and when we have concerns we address those and if they have concerns about something that 's happening in the United States they address that with us that 's no different than Turkey or any other nation question is Turkey attending the Vancouver meeting under secretary goldstein i 'll get back to you on that no i do n't believe they are but i 'll i do n't believe they are question they were question they were a sending state question they were a under secretary goldstein right i 'll get back to you on that question and if you remember ever watching mash question and Greece under secretary goldstein i did i did question yes question and Greece as a matter of fact question well then you remember that the Turks were there under secretary goldstein yes i did watch mash i was about three years old but i did watch it laughter wait a minute i do n't know if i like all that laughter there i said the only part about getting older is that it used to be when i was 50 people would go oh you look like you 're 35 but now that i 'm in my 60s people go oh you look like you 're 58 and i said i do n't know if i consider that such a compliment Laughter question yeah thank you under secretary goldstein does anyone new have a question before i go back to the others well let me just do two more questions and question before you get back to me under secretary goldstein that 's it yeah i 'll come back to you go ahead question i wanted to ask you a very quick question that Arshad raised the other day on the settlements he asked you a question on the building of or the plans for building 1,329 illegal settlements and you said that you would get back to him have you gotten any answer on that under secretary goldstein president Trump has made clear while the existence of settlements are not in themselves an impediment to peace further unrestrained settlement activity does not help advance peace The Israeli Government has made clear that going forward its intent to adopt a policy regarding settlement activity that takes the president 's concern into consideration and the United States welcomes this and we 're hard at work on trying to develop a comprehensive peace plan that would benefit both the Israelis and Palestinians and it will be unveiled when the time is right question Off mike question that 's all well and good but that under secretary goldstein that 's as far as question but that statement is almost a year old now under secretary goldstein yes well that is that 's the position that we have question and in in that in the intervening in the time between that when that statement was first made and now there have been thousands and thousands of new settlement construction projects announced so i the question is are you satisfied with the Israeli response to the president 's expression of concern about this or are you not satisfied under secretary goldstein we believe that it is in the government 's interest to adopt a policy regarding settlement activity and we are working towards that question but you believe under secretary goldstein i ca n't go any further than question that 's fine under secretary goldstein i ca n't go any question but they seem to have adopted a policy question they have a policy question of building more and more under secretary goldstein i 've stated what our position is question to follow Said 's previous question under secretary goldstein our position will not change in the next in the past 30 seconds but i 'm happy to question on the UNRWA funding is it your understanding that if UNRWA no longer has any money that the responsibility for the refugees devolves on the occupying power under secretary goldstein i think you 're making an assumption of what will occur and that 's not an assumption that i would make we have not halted funding to UNRWA the decision is under review there are still deliberations taking place let 's not make let 's wait until that deliberation occurs question but it is the responsibility of an occupying power to look after refugees under secretary goldstein it 's the responsibility it 's the responsibility of the secretary of State to make a decision on that and he and he will after he 's had appropriate deliberation question on China under secretary goldstein One more question right in the back right there question when that would be expected under secretary goldstein well we do n't have a timetable to be expected question the secretary under secretary goldstein but when it does question so it is wide open under secretary goldstein well when we do n't have a timetable to be when it 's to be expected but when it does occur i will let you know i am will be up here for as long as you need me and i appreciate you taking the time today question thank you under secretary goldstein i hope all of you have a nice thursday and a good weekend thank you so much question thank you"
"July 17, 2019",question welcome back America i 'm Hugh Hewitt in the ReliefFactor.com studio thank you for joining me this morning now i 'm joined and honored always to have the United States secretary of State Michael Pompeo as my guest Good morning mr. secretary how are you secretary pompeo i 'm very good Hugh how are you today question i am terrific on the West Coast we had a great day at the Nixon Library yesterday ambassador Grenell was out talking about the Trump doctrine quoting you that America first does not mean America alone is that the most succinct statement you think of it secretary pompeo yeah look it 's a good description i know there have been those who critique us but our fundamental obligation as leaders here in the United States is to make sure America is secure that requires us to work with partners all around the world to develop coalitions but our focus our focus is always on American national security question well ambassador Grenell echoing your point of view yesterday very well now i want to talk about the ministerial the second annual ministerial on religious liberty that 's the bulk of our time but a couple of quick questions on Iran and the headliners it appears that Iran has seized the United Arab Emirates tanker do we know where it is and will we help the UAE get it back secretary pompeo so i ca n't say much about that but we are we 're following very closely what 's taking place more broadly even than just this tanker in the Strait of Hormuz the president 's made pretty clear that this is an international obligation to keep these waterways open and we 're working diligently to build out a maritime security initiative a broad range of countries participating in that the Iranians effort to deny transit for commercial vessels crude oil vessels and other vessels is something that frankly it 's consistent with 40 years of their history and it 's something that the United States is prepared to do our part to make sure that those waterways remain open question now congressman Gallagher told me earlier on the show that the UAE is known as little sparta would they do something without our cooperation if they think their tanker has been seized by the mullahs secretary pompeo i hate to speculate there 's no doubt the Emirates will make the decisions that they believe is in their national interest but they are a great partner we work closely with them every day not only in the region but on matters around the world and they too share our commitment to ensuring that Iran is not an abnormal nation that it ceases its destabilizing activity there and so we have a great partner in the United Arab Emirates question all right last Iran question if they want a war there 's very little we can do to prevent that if they want a conflict and they keep poking the bear or in this case the eagle they 're going to get one at what point do you give up on Iran coming to the table ambassador Grenell said the president always invites people to the table i saw you with yesterday on his right hand talking about bringing Iran to the table all instead they do they seize tankers and they fly drones at Saudi Arabian airports they 're not coming to the table secretary pompeo the American people should never underestimate the broad range of responses nor should the Islamic Republic of Iran misunderstand our efforts the best solution here is for the Iranians to decide that the diplomatic path forward is the best one for the people inside of Iran and we try to talk to them because the Iranian regime has clearly done things that are inconsistent with what the Iranian people want but our mission set our mission set is to find a diplomatic path forward that denies Iran the capacity to be the world 's largest state sponsor of terror to continue to build out their missile program through proliferation and gives them no pathway to a nuclear weapon those are the three benchmarks that the president has laid out and we 're going to achieve it what how Iran will choose to respond whether that is by continuing to enrich at higher and higher levels or by taking on kinetic activity the president is prepared with a full range of responses so that we can get to the outcome that we 're looking for question One more follow up i saw you sitting next to the president yesterday i do n't believe foreign minister Zarif sits much next to the supreme leader i think he 's kind of an empty windbag he 's up in New York holding court should we be bothering any time with him should other Americans be meeting with him he just seems to me to be a false flag of moderation when in fact the regime remains the regime it has always been since 1979 secretary pompeo Hugh your core point i think is correct in the end the ayatollah is calling all of the shots 100 percent of them with respect to the big strategic issues inside of Iran and how their national security apparatus will work he has at his right hand side Qasem Soleimani who is driving much of the activity that we 've talked about so far i do n't there view there as being two camps there is a singular set of activities that every leader inside of Iran is responsible for so it is zarif comes around and talks about how he 's the good guy he has been the foreign minister while the Islamic Republic of Iran has taken every action we 've seen and he is equally responsible for those activities question do some of those actions turning to the ministerial and i want to in fact set up the ministerial this is the second annual ministerial on religious freedom i believe it is the first time that we 've had back to back annual ministerials on any subject you 've picked the most important one in the classic statement of rights there are religious rights social rights and economic rights and social rights including political rights and the religious rights really come before anything else because it 's a consequence of what you achieve meaning in your life does Iran suppress religious rights secretary pompeo Every day question and for every person who is not a Shia in the way that they define Shiaism secretary pompeo i think that 's a very accurate description we 've seen how they treat women we 've seen how they treat religious minorities we 've seen how they treat homosexuals we 've seen this is a regime with some of the worst human rights abuses of any country in the world on a consistent basis every day question now we have 114 countries gathered at the State Department there are a thousand representatives from around the globe here i think you 're giving the keynote tomorrow am i right about that mr. secretary secretary pompeo you are question so yesterday i think you ran down victims of religious intolerance and it was a wide variety of people people who have suffered greatly across the world from New Zealand from Sri Lanka from San Diego what was the impact of these speakers and their all different religions have all been persecuted in different places secretary pompeo it 's truly remarkable three days here at the State Department no previous administration has prepared to defend this most basic freedom you talked about that Hugh absent having the capacity to believe what you want and to act in accordance with your own conscience all of the other things that we talk about as freedoms or rights are subservient to this so very important that we advocate on behalf on this Some 80 percent of the people in the world today live in religiously restricted environments so we brought in a group of people yesterday from a broad set of religious backgrounds who have lived in these spaces and who are working tirelessly to help their countries improve on religious freedom in their nation question now it seems to me that it 's a very difficult order but if you could persuade your counterparts in the PRC and Russia that religious freedom practiced by all but the extremes of any faith and every faith has extremes and they can not be allowed to define the religion for which they appear to speak but religious liberty is actually a stabilizing force in any country that embraces genuine broad spectrum religious liberty have you made that argument to president Xi or to others who routinely try and control the house church in China the Catholic Church in China any other protestant denomination and of course we 'll turn to the uighurs in a second but do they get a sense do you get a sense that they actually listen to this argument secretary pompeo it 's a good question we 've certainly made this argument not only to the Chinese but to every country that 's not living up to their obligations for their citizens to give them the religious freedom that they have by right of their humanness it 's absolutely also factually accurate Hugh your predicate of your question which is nations become stronger when they permit their citizens to exercise their core beliefs about who they really are and we make that case to each country about why this is not something that 's just intrinsically good but also good for them in terms of their capacity to build out their country to grow the economy in their nation to keep their country secure and safe this central premise of religious freedom makes countries stronger it does n't create risk which is what i think some of the countries like China are concerned with when they exercise political repression against various religious faiths that makes their country weaker and we 've made this argument and we will continue to build that argument out and try and convince every country including China that it 's in their best interest to increase the religious freedom in their country question well let 's turn specifically to China for a moment they have reached some sort of rapprochement with the Vatican which has left a lot of Catholics unhappy the house church though remains under significant Christian church remains under significant restriction some churches have been torn down burned down but it 's the Uighurs and the Muslim population that is most beleaguered and by an order of magnitude greater than the others can you tell us what it is that 's going on there Eli Lake has a story today saying that China 's campaign against the Uighurs demands a response what do you think mr. secretary secretary pompeo so this administration has responded to this threat to the world in ways that no administration has chosen to do we 've taken it on we 've been very candid about our view you have some million Muslims uighur Muslims there are Kazakhs there are other others there as well that are being detained and put in facilities camps inside of Xinjiang that the whole world when they see it will be repulsed by our mission set is to respond we have lots of issues that we 're dealing with with respect to our relationship with China but to respond in an appropriate way which always begins Hugh with calling it out with identifying it for what it is and appealing to people all over the world to respond in the most fundamental way to say this is unacceptable and demand that there be a change in behavior other responses how we might get this to change i do n't want to get out in front of the president but know that president Trump and the administration take this central core idea of religious liberty as a very important priority for the State Department and indeed all of our government question it is the first human right and i want to quote Eli Lake he says to be clear there are no indications that the Chinese state has committed a mass extermination of the uighurs but its campaign can fairly be called a cultural genocide an attempt to exterminate every shred of the Uighurs language society and history in Xinjiang there is now vast public evidence that China 's campaign has been accelerating since 2016 is that consistent with your understanding mr. secretary secretary pompeo i might not use exactly the same language but the risk is very real and it is the contra and we tell countries around the world it is the exact opposite of what America 's doing today here at the Department of State with our religious freedom ministerial we 've got people here who disagree with us on policy we 've got people here who have faiths that are very different than mine as a Christian evangelical but they 're all here because this mission set this first freedom is so central to success for every country and importantly to give every individual the rights that they deserve and what you 're seeing take place with China is precisely the opposite of that question and Burma you have come out against Burma i want to move though to the Commission on Unalienable Rights because when Jefferson penned the words life liberty and the pursuit of happiness in the pursuit of happiness is necessarily embedded the inalienable right to religious freedom do you believe your new commission will reach that conclusion led by Mary Ann Glendon famed lawyer legal scholar and human rights activist it 's a great development what do you intend for this commission to do secretary Pompeo secretary pompeo so the mission that i have given professor Glendon and her colleagues that will sit on the panel is to go back to the fundamental grounding of human rights that the founders have set forth for us to evaluate the various components of those human rights which ones are central which of this set of rights are core to America 's success and indeed more broadly the success in the world it 's very easy Hugh you 've seen it i 'll bet you 've had 50 people on your show in the last 10 weeks identify some right and that word gets thrown around loosely and that 's dangerous it 's dangerous for two reasons one when you when everything is a right these most fundamental foundational rights are neglected and second when you start to talk about that way that way when you have these broad set of because you know that many nations will fall short of that and it will misdirect American policy we wo n't be focused on those things that are most central to American security around the world and so that 's what we 've tasked them to do to go back and reground we had the State Department has n't done this in decades and decades and i 'm optimistic that they 'll come to a conclusion that will be important for the United States as we move forward thinking about how to frame how the United States speaks about human rights and fundamental rights all around the world question i hope it 's a persuasive effort again thinking of president Xi and his close in circle if they can be persuaded that Jeffersonian democracy and rights language actually stabilizes governments without risking those at the top 's careers and livelihoods that it does n't have to end in the French Revolution secretary Pompeo it can end in the American constitutional order of stability secretary pompeo that 's absolutely the case look the fear in many of these countries is if they if they grant these set of rights that they will lose political control but in fact the opposite is true leadership that takes these rights seriously becomes stronger their people become more capable of helping in the governance of their nation you get good economic benefits too but you get enormous social good that comes from the guarantee of this set of rights question last question of course anything you do is attacked in the Atlantic they have a story by Mattathias Schwartz titled The Religious Freedom Agenda that alleges one can see in the ministerial that you 're holding right now an effort to make Washington the center of a global faith based conservative order with its own doctrine of intervention and hierarchy of values an order that seeks to augment and perhaps even compete with the existing liberal one i know that 's silly i 'd just like your response secretary pompeo yeah maybe that 's the best response we 're very focused on our mission the fact that some on the left have become sort of crazed by the fact that we 're trying to define trying to create this religious freedom around the world or define the central rights for every American i find confusing befuddling and perhaps suggestive that they know they have the wrong end of the stick and we are going to ground America in our constitutional understandings in ways that some they and their colleagues wish would n't happen question does anyone ever read the founding documents anymore secretary Pompeo i suppose they taught them at Harvard Law so you came in contact with them i know they taught them at West Point but does anyone in the Capitol just routinely consult the documents on which our republic resides in which it stands secretary pompeo i have the core documents sitting on my bookshelf here and that includes things that go beyond just the Constitution and our core founding documents but the Declaration of Independence the federalist papers all the things that these great thinkers who set our nation the greatest nation in the history of civilization on the remarkable course it 's been on and if we can stay true to those if we can continue to use those as our guideposts America will continue to prevail in the centuries ahead as well question secretary Pompeo thank you for joining me good luck with your keynote tomorrow at the second annual ministerial i hope there is a third and a fourth secretary pompeo thank you Hugh question mr. secretary thank you secretary pompeo have a good day sir question you too
